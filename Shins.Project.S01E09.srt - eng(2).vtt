(Also, children were filmed under production guidelines.)

00:01:01.623 --> 00:01:04.693
When money was wired to Yun Dong Hee, an incident occurred.

00:01:04.763 --> 00:01:06.463
I'll be waiting, so please be sure to call me.

00:01:06.863 --> 00:01:08.103
A psychiatrist...

00:01:08.433 --> 00:01:10.503
jumped to his death from her apartment.

00:01:10.733 --> 00:01:14.673
- And who was that doctor? - Yun Dong Hee's personal physician.

00:01:15.473 --> 00:01:16.903
Lawyer Cho Pillip!

00:01:16.973 --> 00:01:18.113
Mo Sun Mi?

00:01:18.113 --> 00:01:19.413
This time...

00:01:19.943 --> 00:01:21.983
I really want to help Sun Mi.

00:01:22.313 --> 00:01:24.483
Pillip. Your hunch was right.

00:01:25.453 --> 00:01:27.483
So go for it. I'll have your back.

00:01:28.183 --> 00:01:30.283
I have a favour to ask you.

00:01:30.453 --> 00:01:34.563
That's for you to find out now. What danger Mr. Shin is involved in.

00:01:34.863 --> 00:01:37.863
Every time money gets deposited into Yun Dong Hee's account,

00:01:38.633 --> 00:01:40.493
someone is going to lose their life.

00:01:40.563 --> 00:01:42.903
There's something I wanted to ask you.

00:01:42.903 --> 00:01:43.903
Move!

00:01:45.233 --> 00:01:48.143
I must find him before the police do.

00:01:48.143 --> 00:01:49.843
Open the door, you punk!

00:01:54.813 --> 00:01:55.813
Mr. Shin.

00:01:56.143 --> 00:01:59.353
Before Yun Dong Hee's doctor died, the last person she spoke with...

00:01:59.553 --> 00:02:01.053
was the director of the director of Federal Medical Center.

00:02:02.983 --> 00:02:04.083
The hospital director?

00:02:04.183 --> 00:02:08.893
He's behind Yun Dong Hee's release, or he's the next target.

00:02:09.863 --> 00:02:13.233
What's your theory, Detective Choi?

00:02:13.563 --> 00:02:16.203
That's why I'm going to meet him in person.

00:02:32.383 --> 00:02:34.553
Hey, I got the director's address.

00:02:46.393 --> 00:02:47.393
Excuse me.

00:02:47.663 --> 00:02:48.833
Can you hear me?

00:02:49.903 --> 00:02:51.373
Open the door, you punk!

00:02:53.273 --> 00:02:54.603
Open up, you punk!

00:03:03.883 --> 00:03:06.353
Vehicle 6645 has now entered the Bukbu Interchange.

00:03:18.563 --> 00:03:20.163
Moving into the right lane.

00:03:20.163 --> 00:03:21.463
Approaching from behind to intercept.

00:03:30.873 --> 00:03:34.213
Team 1 is at the Bukbu Tollgate. Moving in to provide rear support.

00:03:56.203 --> 00:03:57.333
Darn it.

00:03:58.733 --> 00:04:00.033
Okay.

00:04:04.913 --> 00:04:08.743
Hey!

00:04:22.263 --> 00:04:23.393
Hey, you there.

00:04:23.923 --> 00:04:25.093
Are you okay?

00:04:33.803 --> 00:04:34.873
Yun Dong Hee.

00:04:50.883 --> 00:04:52.893
(Episode 9)

00:04:55.423 --> 00:04:58.963
Sir, try to stay with me. Okay? Sir.

00:05:05.773 --> 00:05:07.473
(Paramedics)

00:05:08.143 --> 00:05:09.373
(Paramedics)

00:05:10.043 --> 00:05:12.543
Abdominal stab wound. There was significant blood loss.

00:05:12.613 --> 00:05:14.113
There could also be retroperitoneal damage.

00:05:14.473 --> 00:05:16.843
Prep an OR and get him a CT.

00:05:16.913 --> 00:05:19.483
- Are you with General Surgery? - No, Neuropsychiatry.

00:05:34.933 --> 00:05:36.933
(Operation Room)

00:05:43.873 --> 00:05:44.873
Director.

00:05:47.043 --> 00:05:48.283
I'm sorry, we lost him.

00:05:48.583 --> 00:05:50.113
No, please. I'm the one who should be sorry.

00:05:50.543 --> 00:05:53.083
The detective took the knife for me.

00:05:53.083 --> 00:05:54.683
We will catch him. I promise.

00:05:55.523 --> 00:05:56.983
But about Yun Dong Hee...

00:05:57.383 --> 00:05:59.393
How would he have known where you live, Director?

00:06:00.493 --> 00:06:02.463
I have no idea how he knew.

00:06:02.593 --> 00:06:06.463
- Did he say anything to you? - It all happened...

00:06:06.763 --> 00:06:08.133
so fast.

00:06:08.603 --> 00:06:12.003
We've arranged for your protection. There are officers waiting outside.

00:06:12.073 --> 00:06:14.003
- Thank you. - Of course.

00:06:23.613 --> 00:06:27.353
- How is Detective Choi? - He's in surgery right now.

00:06:28.123 --> 00:06:29.853
We'll have to see how his recovery goes.

00:06:30.883 --> 00:06:32.953
You're Director Lee Heo Jun, right?

00:06:33.623 --> 00:06:34.623
Yes, I am.

00:06:35.223 --> 00:06:36.793
I have something to ask you.

00:06:37.423 --> 00:06:41.063
Why would Yun Dong Hee want you dead with so many witnesses around?

00:06:41.563 --> 00:06:42.563
Excuse me, but...

00:06:43.363 --> 00:06:46.233
who are you? You don't look like a cop.

00:06:47.403 --> 00:06:48.403
Fifteen years ago...

00:06:50.543 --> 00:06:53.143
I lost my son to Yun Dong Hee.

00:06:55.283 --> 00:06:56.583
I am so sorry.

00:06:57.783 --> 00:07:00.983
I take full responsibility for my failure to manage the inmates.

00:07:03.623 --> 00:07:04.683
About you and Yun Dong Hee,

00:07:05.153 --> 00:07:07.553
how long have you known each other?

00:07:07.823 --> 00:07:09.263
We have no personal connection.

00:07:10.263 --> 00:07:14.963
It's just that some patients feel anger and resentment.

00:07:15.003 --> 00:07:17.363
And they may express that...

00:07:17.363 --> 00:07:22.173
in irrational, bizarre, and violent ways.

00:07:22.503 --> 00:07:26.873
Can you really call stabbing someone 'bizarre'?

00:07:30.143 --> 00:07:35.853
I meant that some patients express their feelings in a distorted way.

00:07:40.253 --> 00:07:43.793
- Is that so? - I have a question for you.

00:07:45.463 --> 00:07:49.463
Did you know Yun Dong Hee was going to be there?

00:07:50.403 --> 00:07:52.403
No. I went because I was curious.

00:07:53.503 --> 00:07:54.503
About what?

00:07:54.503 --> 00:07:56.043
Detective Choi said...

00:07:56.973 --> 00:07:59.873
the last person to speak with Yun Dong Hee's personal physician...

00:08:00.313 --> 00:08:03.983
was either the mastermind or his target.

00:08:04.743 --> 00:08:06.153
So I went there to find out which it was.

00:08:12.123 --> 00:08:15.463
Are you saying you looked into my call history?

00:08:15.623 --> 00:08:16.693
No.

00:08:17.423 --> 00:08:18.793
I found out by chance.

00:08:24.063 --> 00:08:26.703
You think I'm the one behind him?

00:08:28.003 --> 00:08:30.073
I find that accusation deeply unfair,

00:08:31.543 --> 00:08:33.073
but did you find the answer you were looking for?

00:08:33.373 --> 00:08:34.983
I apologise if I was out of line.

00:08:40.853 --> 00:08:41.883
Doctor...

00:08:42.483 --> 00:08:43.823
The surgery was a success.

00:08:44.623 --> 00:08:47.693
The wound is deep, but fortunately, his internal organs weren't damaged.

00:08:47.753 --> 00:08:50.723
- Thank you. - It's not life-threatening, right?

00:08:50.823 --> 00:08:51.833
Right.

00:08:55.703 --> 00:08:56.703
Are you sure?

00:08:57.103 --> 00:08:59.233
No money was deposited into Yun Dong Hee's account today?

00:08:59.303 --> 00:09:02.073
I told you, there was nothing! Why?

00:09:02.073 --> 00:09:03.443
Did another "accident" happen and that caused someone to die?

00:09:03.573 --> 00:09:06.743
Yun Dong Hee showed up with a knife himself.

00:09:29.833 --> 00:09:33.003
The person you are trying to reach is unavailable...

00:09:46.213 --> 00:09:48.113
- Are you okay? - Detective Choi.

00:09:48.283 --> 00:09:49.423
No, no, don't move.

00:09:49.583 --> 00:09:54.153
He's behind Yun Dong Hee's release, or he's the next target.

00:09:54.353 --> 00:09:55.363
You think I'm the one behind him?

00:09:55.663 --> 00:09:57.593
I find that accusation deeply unfair,

00:09:58.123 --> 00:09:59.363
but did you find the answer you were looking for?

00:10:15.113 --> 00:10:17.943
(Boss Kim)

00:10:19.353 --> 00:10:20.353
Hello.

00:10:20.453 --> 00:10:22.483
Yes, sir. I've got the package ready for you.

00:10:27.293 --> 00:10:29.093
It's been a while since we've been in touch.

00:10:29.623 --> 00:10:31.223
And he hasn't been to work in a long time, either.

00:10:31.833 --> 00:10:32.993
Hold on a second.

00:10:38.373 --> 00:10:41.073
The number you have dialled is not in service.

00:10:44.843 --> 00:10:48.683
He changed his number. Looks like he took off for good.

00:10:52.213 --> 00:10:53.483
Doo Dong Seok?

00:10:53.553 --> 00:10:57.383
Yes, he changed his number. I was wondering if you have it.

00:10:58.223 --> 00:10:59.223
Sorry, I don't.

00:10:59.523 --> 00:11:02.163
By the way, is Lawyer Doo's suspension over?

00:11:02.923 --> 00:11:04.123
Suspension?

00:11:04.863 --> 00:11:07.933
Lawyer Doo's suspension was lifted back in January.

00:11:08.433 --> 00:11:09.663
January...

00:11:10.133 --> 00:11:12.633
So he hid his suspension and got a job as a legal consultant.

00:11:14.173 --> 00:11:18.073
(Chicken Center)

00:11:18.173 --> 00:11:23.083
"As independent, equal partners, working hours are flexible...

00:11:23.143 --> 00:11:25.853
and are not subject to penalties for absence or tardiness."

00:11:25.953 --> 00:11:28.213
We were hit with tons of penalties.

00:11:28.213 --> 00:11:30.183
We paid late fees and had our pay cut.

00:11:30.253 --> 00:11:32.093
- That's right. - What about this part?

00:11:32.093 --> 00:11:34.923
"Maintain dress code and cleanliness."

00:11:34.993 --> 00:11:38.433
He made us clean like maniacs, wiping down every single dumbbell,

00:11:38.563 --> 00:11:40.693
and he'd lose it if there was even a fingerprint on the mirrors.

00:11:40.833 --> 00:11:42.633
And you were penalized for this?

00:11:42.703 --> 00:11:46.673
Yes. If we were late, we had to pay an extra late fee.

00:11:47.073 --> 00:11:48.203
There it is.

00:11:49.003 --> 00:11:51.573
Giving you direct orders about your work hours...

00:11:51.643 --> 00:11:53.643
and then penalizing you for not following them...

00:11:53.743 --> 00:11:56.483
proves he treated you as employees and gave you orders.

00:11:56.713 --> 00:11:59.783
If we sue, a court will likely recognise you as employees.

00:11:59.783 --> 00:12:00.783
I see.

00:12:00.783 --> 00:12:02.923
They tried to pull a fast one and it backfired on them.

00:12:03.453 --> 00:12:04.483
Nice.

00:12:04.823 --> 00:12:06.923
But how long will it take?

00:12:07.193 --> 00:12:09.593
We should see some results within a year.

00:12:09.663 --> 00:12:13.133
A year? We're owed six months' back pay.

00:12:13.863 --> 00:12:16.733
I can't wait that long.

00:12:17.663 --> 00:12:19.733
I don't have the energy or the luxury to wait.

00:12:21.003 --> 00:12:22.773
Hold on. Pillip!

00:12:23.243 --> 00:12:24.473
Come on, is there any other way?

00:12:24.673 --> 00:12:28.273
Come on, some other article or clause in the law books.

00:12:33.683 --> 00:12:34.783
How about this?

00:12:40.993 --> 00:12:41.993
Sun Mi.

00:12:43.363 --> 00:12:44.693
What are you doing here all alone?

00:12:45.933 --> 00:12:48.603
So much for Bali. Look where I ended up.

00:12:50.433 --> 00:12:51.873
I haven't had a drink in forever.

00:12:54.903 --> 00:12:57.703
So why do you want to go to Bali?

00:13:00.873 --> 00:13:03.143
Because it's so suffocating here.

00:13:04.943 --> 00:13:07.153
I thought things would get better if I just kept working.

00:13:07.483 --> 00:13:10.623
I kept telling myself it'd be okay if I just held on, but...

00:13:11.923 --> 00:13:14.253
when I look back, I was just getting pushed around and worn down...

00:13:15.593 --> 00:13:18.023
and I had nothing left to show for it.

00:13:19.763 --> 00:13:23.033
And before I knew it,

00:13:23.563 --> 00:13:25.533
I'd completely forgotten what I really wanted to do.

00:13:26.873 --> 00:13:28.103
I know what you mean.

00:13:29.243 --> 00:13:31.303
For me too, up until just recently,

00:13:32.313 --> 00:13:35.443
what I wanted to do didn't matter at all.

00:13:40.513 --> 00:13:46.353
That's why I was so grateful to Lawyer Cho.

00:13:47.553 --> 00:13:48.563
Why is that?

00:13:48.663 --> 00:13:53.663
He told me that being pushed around isn't something you have to accept.

00:13:55.633 --> 00:13:58.673
Getting our staff all their back pay.

00:13:58.973 --> 00:14:01.073
Keeping my promise to our members.

00:14:02.403 --> 00:14:05.843
And after all that, I'm going to figure out...

00:14:06.243 --> 00:14:07.713
what I really want to do.

00:14:14.353 --> 00:14:15.353
Get home safe.

00:14:18.283 --> 00:14:19.993
Looks like you've got plans.

00:14:20.923 --> 00:14:23.393
Yes. I've got a curfew.

00:14:28.433 --> 00:14:30.603
- Take care. - Thanks for dinner.

00:14:30.663 --> 00:14:32.803
- See you next time. - I'll be in touch.

00:14:40.743 --> 00:14:41.743
What is it?

00:15:03.903 --> 00:15:05.733
What do you think you're doing?

00:15:05.733 --> 00:15:07.803
I know you have no appetite, but please eat.

00:15:07.873 --> 00:15:11.043
You lost so much blood. You need to eat to get your strength.

00:15:11.173 --> 00:15:13.713
Hey, my blood is boiling right now as it is.

00:15:14.513 --> 00:15:18.653
Besides, I got stabbed in the gut, not my hands. I can feed myself.

00:15:18.983 --> 00:15:20.053
Stop that.

00:15:21.313 --> 00:15:23.223
Still no luck finding Yun Dong Hee's car?

00:15:23.423 --> 00:15:27.253
Don't even ask. The Team Leader said it's personal,

00:15:27.353 --> 00:15:28.393
so he's out looking for him himself.

00:15:28.523 --> 00:15:31.193
But they tracked the traffic CCTVs, right?

00:15:31.293 --> 00:15:33.333
They lost the trail at an intersection.

00:15:33.333 --> 00:15:34.763
I was in the situation room...

00:15:34.833 --> 00:15:36.463
and then I came to bring you your meal.

00:15:36.633 --> 00:15:38.773
Why would you be the one to bring my...

00:15:40.533 --> 00:15:43.473
Hey! I'll eat on my own,

00:15:43.843 --> 00:15:45.773
so you go and give me a status report or something.

00:15:45.973 --> 00:15:48.843
I can't do that. Team Leader said until you've eaten,

00:15:48.983 --> 00:15:52.683
- I'm to stay by your side. - Go stand there. You're hovering.

00:15:52.753 --> 00:15:55.113
Just have a little bit. Please?

00:16:00.493 --> 00:16:01.723
Mr. Shin.

00:16:02.023 --> 00:16:03.123
Hey, could you step outside for a minute?

00:16:03.793 --> 00:16:04.793
Yes, sir.

00:16:09.563 --> 00:16:13.433
- How are you feeling? - It's been a wake-up call.

00:16:13.773 --> 00:16:16.103
I'm furious I let that jerk get away right in front of me,

00:16:17.873 --> 00:16:19.443
and it's humiliating that I got hurt. Darn it.

00:16:20.273 --> 00:16:21.473
I'm so sorry.

00:16:22.243 --> 00:16:23.943
I feel like I pushed you into it,

00:16:24.913 --> 00:16:26.983
and that's why you got hurt, Detective Choi.

00:16:27.413 --> 00:16:29.023
No, that's not it at all.

00:16:29.553 --> 00:16:32.723
A cop's job is to catch criminals. It's just what we do.

00:16:33.023 --> 00:16:37.663
Now I have a personal reason to chase him to the end of the earth.

00:16:38.733 --> 00:16:41.263
Detective Choi, I looked into it,

00:16:42.403 --> 00:16:45.033
and there were no payments made to Yun Dong Hee this time.

00:16:45.833 --> 00:16:46.833
That's weird.

00:16:48.673 --> 00:16:50.773
So it wasn't a hit job this time.

00:16:51.143 --> 00:16:52.673
He acted on his own?

00:16:53.173 --> 00:16:54.343
Detective Choi.

00:16:55.013 --> 00:16:58.083
On October 11th and November 11th, 2009,

00:16:58.343 --> 00:16:59.813
did something happen?

00:17:02.683 --> 00:17:03.683
(Death of Han Ji Young, October 11th, 2009)

00:17:03.683 --> 00:17:05.693
Ji Young!

00:17:05.953 --> 00:17:07.193
Ji Young...

00:17:14.893 --> 00:17:16.863
(Death of Lee Han Jun, November 11th, 2009)

00:17:31.083 --> 00:17:35.523
His blood and tox screen were clean. Nothing out of the ordinary.

00:17:43.763 --> 00:17:45.393
He was there on the day Han Ji Young died.

00:17:51.863 --> 00:17:54.533
Lee Han Jun was at a soup restaurant right before his accident.

00:17:54.733 --> 00:17:57.973
If you look here, you see this guy, right?

00:17:58.043 --> 00:17:59.043
And...

00:18:00.713 --> 00:18:03.013
On the day Han Ji Young died. Look at this.

00:18:03.113 --> 00:18:04.243
It's the same guy.

00:18:04.943 --> 00:18:05.953
Who is he?

00:18:06.883 --> 00:18:07.913
Yun Dong Hee.

00:18:11.223 --> 00:18:12.553
Do you...

00:18:13.523 --> 00:18:14.623
know who these people are?

00:18:24.003 --> 00:18:25.233
I've never seen them before.

00:18:26.633 --> 00:18:28.803
Both cases were ruled accidental deaths,

00:18:29.143 --> 00:18:30.973
but to me, they're still cold cases.

00:18:31.543 --> 00:18:33.273
The same goes for Cha So Yeon's case.

00:18:34.073 --> 00:18:38.083
- Are the three of them connected? - I looked into it,

00:18:38.443 --> 00:18:41.253
and Cha So Yeon has no connection to the other two.

00:18:41.713 --> 00:18:42.853
But I'm certain...

00:18:44.283 --> 00:18:45.493
there's something more to it.

(Shin Jay)

00:19:32.063 --> 00:19:33.073
(Shin Jay, meaning a shoe seller)

00:19:33.273 --> 00:19:34.273
(If the shoe-seller comes, I'll buy you a pair)

00:19:43.283 --> 00:19:46.353
I figured you might need some tools, so I had my boys bring some over.

00:19:46.753 --> 00:19:47.783
Use them as you please.

00:19:48.953 --> 00:19:50.823
- Hey. - Yes, Mr. Shin.

00:19:50.883 --> 00:19:53.323
Let's say someone gives you about a million bucks...

00:19:53.853 --> 00:19:56.763
and asks you to take someone out. What would you do?

00:19:57.123 --> 00:19:58.123
A million bucks?

00:19:58.393 --> 00:19:59.793
For that much, I'd wipe them off the face of the earth.

00:20:00.293 --> 00:20:02.363
Of course, I'm out of the game now,

00:20:02.703 --> 00:20:05.103
but for a million bucks, I might reconsider.

00:20:05.203 --> 00:20:06.933
So, do you think...

00:20:07.233 --> 00:20:09.743
a guy who was paid for killing people...

00:20:09.743 --> 00:20:12.343
would do a job like that for free?

00:20:13.073 --> 00:20:15.343
But then again, who would do business at a loss?

00:20:15.783 --> 00:20:16.943
To be blunt,

00:20:17.213 --> 00:20:19.213
Getting involved will cause you trouble...

00:20:19.213 --> 00:20:20.383
and ruin your entire business.

00:20:21.083 --> 00:20:22.683
In that case, it's usually...

00:20:23.123 --> 00:20:27.293
either I wanted to kill him myself, or I messed up. One of the two.

00:20:28.793 --> 00:20:30.023
So it is about the money, right?

00:20:30.363 --> 00:20:32.063
In capitalism, money can do anything.

00:20:32.063 --> 00:20:33.833
For a million bucks? Even more so.

00:20:35.163 --> 00:20:36.803

Pull up the medical records and visitation log for Yun Dong Hee.

00:20:51.343 --> 00:20:52.853
Just the most recent ones?

00:20:54.413 --> 00:20:55.623
No, all of them. From the very beginning.

00:20:55.983 --> 00:20:57.053
Yes, of course.

Pressing charges?

00:21:37.023 --> 00:21:38.623
Hey, I thought you said you weren't going to sue.

00:21:38.723 --> 00:21:41.593
I'm not. What good would suing do me?

00:21:41.733 --> 00:21:44.463
Even with a fast-tracked trial, it would still take over a year.

00:21:44.533 --> 00:21:47.103
- Then what? - I have to get my back pay first.

00:21:47.333 --> 00:21:49.443
Right, but how are you going to do that?

00:21:52.273 --> 00:21:54.073
By shaking it out of that evil lawyer.

What brings you here without calling first?

00:22:02.583 --> 00:22:05.583
I did call ahead. I called your assistant.

Okay.

00:22:21.303 --> 00:22:22.333
I'm back.

00:22:23.103 --> 00:22:25.303
- Back from a delivery? - Yes. You're here.

Perfect timing.

00:22:26.513 --> 00:22:28.673
Perfect timing? What's with the perfect timing?

00:22:36.083 --> 00:22:39.923
The front page is Charles Hong's arrival time and flight number,

00:22:39.993 --> 00:22:41.753
the back has Doo Dong Seok's stuff.

00:22:41.753 --> 00:22:42.963
Who's this Charles Hong?

00:22:43.023 --> 00:22:44.423
The CEO of PHG.

00:22:45.093 --> 00:22:47.733
Until last year, Doo Dong Seok had his salary paid...

00:22:47.733 --> 00:22:49.163
to his wife's account,

00:22:49.303 --> 00:22:51.803
but starting this January, he switched it to his own account.

00:22:51.863 --> 00:22:56.003
He waited for his suspension to end. You're really incredible.

00:22:56.373 --> 00:22:59.143
I told you. This stuff is a piece of cake to him.

00:22:59.213 --> 00:23:02.743
But why would you help Pillip with this?

00:23:02.883 --> 00:23:04.343
What happened to your give-and-take?

00:23:04.343 --> 00:23:06.783
This is a give-and-take.

00:23:06.853 --> 00:23:07.853
It really is.

00:23:07.913 --> 00:23:10.353
I promised I'd get the Bazaar Resident Consent Form signed.

00:23:10.523 --> 00:23:12.793
Aren't you two a team?

00:23:12.853 --> 00:23:15.523
Doo Dong Seok didn't just deceive his staff.

00:23:15.523 --> 00:23:16.723
He deceived Charles Hong, too.

00:23:16.923 --> 00:23:19.963
He violated the attorney's code and embezzled and breached trust.

00:23:20.633 --> 00:23:23.503
Charles Hong must get the evidence before he meets with Doo Dong Seok.

00:23:23.563 --> 00:23:25.933
I'll go to the airport and give Charles Hong the evidence.

00:23:26.233 --> 00:23:27.533
You'll be okay on your own?

00:23:27.933 --> 00:23:30.503
- Of course. - Then I'll handle Doo Dong Seok.

00:23:30.743 --> 00:23:32.713
I'll make sure he can never practice law again.

Si On, your GED exam is coming up. Should you be running around now?

00:23:37.483 --> 00:23:41.983
We have to catch a guy this evil. He crushed young people's hopes!

00:23:42.153 --> 00:23:44.383
- Good. - That was awesome.

00:23:44.823 --> 00:23:48.453
That's our Si On, always on the ball.

00:23:51.763 --> 00:23:53.693
- Kim Pro. - Yes?

00:23:53.763 --> 00:23:54.763
One second.

00:23:58.133 --> 00:23:59.133
What?

00:23:59.133 --> 00:24:01.303
The Yun Dong Hee link you mentioned.

00:24:01.773 --> 00:24:04.603
- Can you send me a link too? - A link?

00:24:04.743 --> 00:24:08.013
You said he gets a coded text every time a deposit is made, right?

00:24:08.173 --> 00:24:11.443
I suppose I can send one, but do you think he'll even read it?

00:24:11.743 --> 00:24:13.753
It seems like he only checks certain messages.

00:24:13.813 --> 00:24:15.183
Just send one for me.

00:24:15.453 --> 00:24:16.553
With the same code.

00:24:16.853 --> 00:24:19.083
So when he clicks it, my message will pop up.

00:24:19.753 --> 00:24:21.353
What do you want it to say?

00:24:21.423 --> 00:24:23.963
I'll worry about what it says.

00:24:23.963 --> 00:24:26.693
You just create the link for me, all right?

Right now?

00:24:50.783 --> 00:24:51.783
Got it.

00:24:57.823 --> 00:24:58.823
Boss Kim...

00:24:59.163 --> 00:25:00.693
Boss Kim...

00:25:00.993 --> 00:25:03.033
He's a construction contractor and used to be a gangster.

00:25:13.773 --> 00:25:15.013
What is he giving him?

00:25:23.323 --> 00:25:24.483
The machines are gone?

00:25:24.923 --> 00:25:26.523
What are you talking about?

00:25:29.923 --> 00:25:32.793
Hey, who would steal something that heavy?

00:25:33.963 --> 00:25:35.263
I'm telling you, it's true.

00:25:36.603 --> 00:25:38.503
You sure they're not just skimming and lying about it?

00:25:38.563 --> 00:25:41.273
We dealt with them when we sold the first branch's machines.

00:25:41.433 --> 00:25:43.273
I'm telling you, I already went to their warehouse and checked.

00:25:43.343 --> 00:25:45.273
Then who took them?

00:25:46.073 --> 00:25:48.713
Hey, that's 30 grand we're talking about! 30 grand!

00:25:48.973 --> 00:25:51.443
Seriously, why is your second branch always causing problems?

00:25:52.313 --> 00:25:53.313
I'm sorry, sir.

00:25:55.313 --> 00:25:56.323
Unbelievable.

00:26:16.103 --> 00:26:17.273
What is he giving him?

00:26:20.213 --> 00:26:23.313
- What's this key for? - Remember when we went to the gym?

00:26:24.013 --> 00:26:27.913
You saw the gear's price list, right? And the QR stickers?

00:26:28.383 --> 00:26:29.523
That's how I figured it out.

00:26:30.023 --> 00:26:31.123
Hey, Boss Kim.

00:26:31.483 --> 00:26:34.293
Are your guys still good at flexing their muscles?

00:26:35.423 --> 00:26:36.693
Man, don't even get me started.

00:26:37.563 --> 00:26:40.063
When my guys bowl, they shatter pins.

00:26:40.063 --> 00:26:41.793
When they play ball, they break bats.

00:26:42.493 --> 00:26:44.433
All the boys are former athletes.

00:26:45.563 --> 00:26:47.503
Boss, we're ready.

00:26:47.873 --> 00:26:48.873
All right, get it done.

00:26:49.743 --> 00:26:51.603
- Let's go, move it. - Yes, sir.

00:27:01.353 --> 00:27:02.383
What is wrong?

00:27:08.093 --> 00:27:10.293
We're here for the gear, but it's gone.

00:27:10.293 --> 00:27:11.323
Did you sell it to someone else?

00:27:11.793 --> 00:27:13.633
The door won't even open. What's he talking about?

00:27:14.233 --> 00:27:15.793
I'm telling you, come and see for yourself.

00:27:16.433 --> 00:27:18.563
You're the one who took the gym gear?

00:27:19.133 --> 00:27:21.933
I got there first and took it.

00:27:22.603 --> 00:27:25.443
If I hadn't, the secondhand dealer would've taken it.

00:27:26.243 --> 00:27:29.013
If we sell it, for the trainers who came with Mo Sun Mi,

00:27:29.613 --> 00:27:31.143
it'll cover their salaries for a few months.

00:27:31.943 --> 00:27:32.953
But that's stealing.

00:27:33.053 --> 00:27:37.023
No! If I hadn't, Doo Dong Seok would have kept it.

00:27:37.483 --> 00:27:39.123
And you think that jerk would've sold it...

00:27:39.993 --> 00:27:42.493
and used the money to pay the employees their back wages?

00:27:46.333 --> 00:27:47.933
It's your call, Pillip.

00:27:48.363 --> 00:27:50.703
You can either give it back to those con artists...

00:27:51.533 --> 00:27:53.173
or sell it and pay the staff.

00:28:06.253 --> 00:28:08.853
Right. What they're doing is illegal, so...

00:28:08.953 --> 00:28:10.053
But it's stolen property.

00:28:10.853 --> 00:28:12.153
It's stolen property.

00:28:14.123 --> 00:28:17.393
But if I sell it, I could pay some wages, right?

00:28:18.693 --> 00:28:20.693
But am I even allowed to sell it?

00:28:21.633 --> 00:28:24.603
It's stolen property. But I could pay off the wages.

00:28:24.703 --> 00:28:25.863
But that would make me a criminal too.

00:28:31.173 --> 00:28:32.503
I don't know!

00:28:34.073 --> 00:28:35.073
I don't know!

00:28:45.553 --> 00:28:47.123
And you think that jerk would've sold it...

00:28:47.353 --> 00:28:49.793
and used the money to pay the employees their back wages?

00:28:51.223 --> 00:28:52.693
It's your call, Pillip.

00:28:53.163 --> 00:28:55.493
You can either give it back to those con artists...

00:28:55.963 --> 00:28:57.563
or sell it and pay the staff.

00:29:05.203 --> 00:29:06.773
Hello, is this the place that buys used gym equipment?

00:29:08.343 --> 00:29:09.983
(Welcome, CEO Charles Hong)

00:29:17.283 --> 00:29:18.683
- Si On. - I'm startled.

00:29:18.683 --> 00:29:19.993
Mr, Shin.

00:29:21.223 --> 00:29:22.523
What are you doing here?

00:29:23.423 --> 00:29:25.423
I wanted to see what this Charles Hong guy looks like.

00:29:25.863 --> 00:29:29.093
A boss taking vacations abroad with his employees' wages...

00:29:29.093 --> 00:29:31.663
must have some serious nerve, don't you think?

00:29:33.673 --> 00:29:36.403
- You were worried, weren't you? - No.

00:29:36.773 --> 00:29:39.243
Of all of us, you're the one I worry about the least.

00:29:41.373 --> 00:29:45.243
I was a little intimidated, but I'm glad you're here now.

00:29:46.013 --> 00:29:48.853
The airport is so much bigger than I expected.

00:29:49.213 --> 00:29:50.823
And there are tons of people.

00:29:51.853 --> 00:29:53.853
They can't all be here to catch a flight, right?

00:29:54.053 --> 00:29:56.053
We're not here to catch a flight either.

00:29:56.963 --> 00:30:00.193
Si On. We should come back to fly next time...

00:30:00.333 --> 00:30:01.333
with Ye On.

00:30:02.133 --> 00:30:03.133
I'd love that.

00:30:07.073 --> 00:30:08.133
- Oh! - What?

00:30:08.133 --> 00:30:09.403
There he is.

00:30:14.813 --> 00:30:16.213
(Welcome, CEO Charles Hong)

00:30:16.513 --> 00:30:17.983
Dong Seok sent you, I take it?

00:30:19.243 --> 00:30:20.813
You're CEO Charles Hong, right?

00:30:21.683 --> 00:30:22.753
Yes, I am.

00:30:23.383 --> 00:30:25.223
I'm Charles Hong.

00:30:27.823 --> 00:30:29.493
Seriously...

00:30:30.063 --> 00:30:31.063
And you are?

00:30:31.563 --> 00:30:34.393
Is this the pushover Doo Dong Seok was talking about?

00:30:35.363 --> 00:30:36.363
Pushover?

00:30:36.433 --> 00:30:39.363
Not a pushover. Then what was it? A figurehead?

00:30:39.603 --> 00:30:43.443
- What? - Your so-called legal adviser...

00:30:44.043 --> 00:30:48.073
breaks the law, committing fraud, embezzlement, and breach of trust.

00:30:48.873 --> 00:30:50.283
Did you know about that?

00:30:50.883 --> 00:30:54.683
Who are you accusing of these crimes?

00:30:54.683 --> 00:30:55.753
He is definitely a pushover.

00:30:56.183 --> 00:30:57.183
Manager Lee.

00:30:57.423 --> 00:30:59.383
- Yes, sir. - You brought the documents, right?

00:30:59.523 --> 00:31:00.523
Of course.

00:31:05.363 --> 00:31:07.363
You think you're getting these for free?

00:31:08.463 --> 00:31:13.103
- So, what do you want from me? - Let's have a word.

00:31:22.081 --> 00:31:23.381
So...

00:31:24.451 --> 00:31:26.821
What exactly did Dong Seok skim off the top?

00:31:27.021 --> 00:31:30.691
It says right here. Acted as an unlicensed legal advisor,

00:31:30.791 --> 00:31:34.891
siphoned off money for unpaid wages, and skimmed the holiday bonuses.

00:31:35.061 --> 00:31:37.761
And when he sold the gym equipment, he skimmed a commission off the top.

00:31:38.161 --> 00:31:40.771
You're making a big deal out of chump change.

00:31:40.931 --> 00:31:43.371
What a pushover.

00:31:43.901 --> 00:31:47.641
You'll be flooded with lawsuits for embezzlement and whatnot.

00:31:48.141 --> 00:31:50.611
Yes, right. You can go to jail over a few bucks.

00:31:50.681 --> 00:31:52.281
And pay your debt by doing time.

00:31:52.651 --> 00:31:53.911
Jail? You mean actual jail?

00:31:54.581 --> 00:31:56.051
Why me?

00:31:56.051 --> 00:31:57.821
If you do the crime, you do the time.

00:31:58.151 --> 00:32:00.221
You totally lied to your employees about the Bali Branch.

00:32:00.391 --> 00:32:01.551
What Bali Branch?

00:32:01.691 --> 00:32:04.061
You strung them along, saying they'd be the manager of the Bali Branch!

00:32:04.161 --> 00:32:05.391
Don't talk to me so casually.

00:32:05.861 --> 00:32:09.731
- That son of a... - Look, there is no Bali Branch,

00:32:09.961 --> 00:32:12.261
so how could they be the manager?

00:32:12.501 --> 00:32:17.171
Dong Seok just said Bali was great, so I went there on vacation.

00:32:18.171 --> 00:32:20.941
Look at this sucker. Just look at him.

00:32:21.541 --> 00:32:24.411
Dong Seok really screwed you over.

00:32:25.341 --> 00:32:28.811
And Doo Dong Seok also bought a 3 million dollar house in Gangnam.

00:32:28.881 --> 00:32:31.151
- All in cash. - Three million dollars?

00:32:31.221 --> 00:32:32.951
- Yes. - Three million dollars?

00:32:37.021 --> 00:32:38.891
You didn't even know that?

00:32:39.361 --> 00:32:41.131
You're the king of all suckers.

00:32:47.231 --> 00:32:49.071
Do you know where Doo Dong Seok is right now?

00:32:52.541 --> 00:32:53.571
Come on.

00:32:56.341 --> 00:32:58.341
Hey! You...

00:32:58.411 --> 00:32:59.411
What are you doing here?

00:33:05.791 --> 00:33:07.791
- Going on a trip? - What? Why are you here?

00:33:07.921 --> 00:33:11.761
Why do you think? I'm here to permanently disbar you.

00:33:13.631 --> 00:33:15.861
Permanently disbarred? Don't give me that crap.

00:33:16.361 --> 00:33:18.831
Hey, are you trying to threaten me?

00:33:19.001 --> 00:33:21.231
You can't touch me legally.

00:33:21.501 --> 00:33:23.801
That Mo Sun Mi girl? I gave her money.

00:33:23.871 --> 00:33:27.341
And just in case, I even got her to sign a receipt.

00:33:27.471 --> 00:33:30.381
Yes. You gave her one month's pay and called it the full amount.

00:33:30.441 --> 00:33:31.841
And used legalese to pass it off as full payment?

00:33:35.351 --> 00:33:36.351
You...

00:33:37.921 --> 00:33:40.421
seem to think you're pretty clever.

00:33:40.951 --> 00:33:42.051
So, where should I start?

00:33:42.861 --> 00:33:44.591
- What? - How about unlicensed practice?

00:33:45.421 --> 00:33:46.761
Violating labour laws?

00:33:47.131 --> 00:33:49.201
Or how about embezzling company funds behind the CEO's back?

00:33:49.261 --> 00:33:50.261
Come on...

00:33:51.961 --> 00:33:52.971
Get in the car. Let's talk in there.

00:33:53.031 --> 00:33:54.901
No way! Why would I get in a criminal's car?

00:33:54.971 --> 00:33:57.441
Criminal? There's no criminal...

00:33:57.601 --> 00:34:00.071
- Isn't that Mr. Doo, the lawyer? - Yes, that's him.

00:34:01.171 --> 00:34:03.841
Yes, hello. Please, go on in. Yes.

00:34:03.911 --> 00:34:07.351
- What do you think you're doing? - Help! A lawyer's kidnapping me!

00:34:07.481 --> 00:34:09.851
- Who? Who's kidnapping someone? - Sir.

00:34:09.921 --> 00:34:11.381
- Yes? - Should we call the police?

00:34:11.451 --> 00:34:13.521
No, no, it's all right. Please, just go on inside. Go on.

00:34:13.591 --> 00:34:15.921
My friend here just has a really loud voice.

00:34:16.791 --> 00:34:18.921
Why are you doing this to me?

00:34:19.461 --> 00:34:20.661
Unbelievable.

00:34:25.871 --> 00:34:26.871
Hey.

00:34:27.731 --> 00:34:32.041
You can't use this in court anyway. It's inadmissible.

00:34:32.271 --> 00:34:33.911
And what? Embezzlement?

00:34:34.041 --> 00:34:37.681
Charles is the one who authorized that.

00:34:37.741 --> 00:34:39.081
You don't even know what you're talking about!

00:34:39.551 --> 00:34:40.911
Who said anything about using it in court?

00:34:42.251 --> 00:34:44.081
This kind of thing is usually used for...

00:34:44.621 --> 00:34:48.191
Whistleblowing, sowing discord, public humiliation.

00:34:48.721 --> 00:34:50.861
In a word, complete social ruin.

00:34:51.161 --> 00:34:52.691
Pillip, why are you doing this to me?

00:34:52.931 --> 00:34:56.431
First, sign here, and pay the employees their back pay.

00:34:56.631 --> 00:34:59.131
Do that, and maybe I'll cut you some slack.

00:34:59.871 --> 00:35:02.471
- But if you don't... - So what if I don't? What then?

00:35:07.011 --> 00:35:08.671
- Jenny. - Daddy!

00:35:09.181 --> 00:35:12.581
Oh, there's my girl. Oh, my goodness.

00:35:12.651 --> 00:35:13.981
- You have fun at preschool today? - Yes.

00:35:14.011 --> 00:35:16.421
- Aren't you a cutie? - So you must be Jenny.

00:35:23.521 --> 00:35:24.521
Hey, you big sucker.

00:35:25.161 --> 00:35:30.001
If it were me, first thing I'd do is chop off his hand.

00:35:30.061 --> 00:35:33.201
That's the hand he used to steal your identity...

00:35:33.271 --> 00:35:35.101
and forged all kinds of documents.

00:35:36.041 --> 00:35:37.571
Are you threatening me?

00:35:37.841 --> 00:35:41.741
A threat is what might happen. I'm telling you what will happen.

00:35:42.581 --> 00:35:44.241
You want me to tell you what happens next?

00:35:46.051 --> 00:35:48.051
Keep going. This is getting interesting.

00:35:48.111 --> 00:35:51.381
Your cards will be cancelled, accounts frozen, and charges filed.

00:35:51.951 --> 00:35:54.421
I'll post in your building group chat.

00:35:54.421 --> 00:35:56.921
"The Scumbag Lawyer in Unit 1103."

00:35:57.991 --> 00:35:59.491
Your kid at preschool...

00:35:59.861 --> 00:36:02.701
and your wife will be the talk of the town.

00:36:03.301 --> 00:36:05.801
She might even ask for a divorce.

00:36:07.371 --> 00:36:10.801
There's nothing to even think about, man.

00:36:11.071 --> 00:36:13.511
Either you go down with Dong Seok,

00:36:13.641 --> 00:36:16.381
or you crawl your way out of this mess alone.

00:36:16.611 --> 00:36:18.081
Or you can just sign.

00:36:19.711 --> 00:36:20.751
I'll give you three minutes.

00:36:25.581 --> 00:36:28.191
(Three Minutes)

00:36:28.591 --> 00:36:30.061
You're running out of time.

00:36:32.531 --> 00:36:34.661
- Two minutes, 30 seconds. - Oh, come on.

00:36:37.831 --> 00:36:39.101
Daddy's sorry.

00:36:44.541 --> 00:36:45.541
Excuse me...

00:36:45.841 --> 00:36:47.071
I'm here to turn myself in.

00:36:48.211 --> 00:36:50.641
(Police)

00:36:51.281 --> 00:36:52.651
I'm here to turn myself in.

00:36:59.951 --> 00:37:03.591
The other instructors got paid too. Thank you so much.

00:37:03.661 --> 00:37:05.321
- Thank you. - Thank you.

00:37:05.421 --> 00:37:06.631
This is so great.

00:37:07.161 --> 00:37:10.601
So the store manager and that lawyer will be punished, right?

00:37:11.031 --> 00:37:13.101
The sentence for withholding wages is pretty light.

00:37:13.501 --> 00:37:17.141
He paid it all back and surrendered, so they'll probably go easy on him.

00:37:17.201 --> 00:37:18.271
But wait,

00:37:18.741 --> 00:37:21.111
But we just barely got the money we were owed.

00:37:21.371 --> 00:37:23.281
And on top of that, we lost our jobs.

00:37:23.811 --> 00:37:26.281
Then why do they get off so easy?

00:37:26.351 --> 00:37:28.451
That's just how the law works.

00:37:28.981 --> 00:37:30.751
That's what Doo Dong Seok was counting on.

00:37:33.091 --> 00:37:36.021
That's why I had to get a little creative.

00:37:37.191 --> 00:37:39.261
It takes a legal thug to catch an evil lawyer,

00:37:39.561 --> 00:37:40.591
and that's me.

00:37:40.861 --> 00:37:42.601
The wages you all just received...

00:37:42.961 --> 00:37:44.531
I squeezed them out of Doo Dong Seok himself.

00:37:47.131 --> 00:37:48.231
Really?

00:37:48.501 --> 00:37:49.671
Thank you.

00:37:50.241 --> 00:37:53.111
- You're exactly what you described. - Thank you.

00:37:54.141 --> 00:37:55.211
They're quite similar.

00:37:56.011 --> 00:37:58.241
Officer, as you can see,

00:37:58.581 --> 00:38:01.711
all of this was all Charles Hong's plan. I just...

00:38:01.781 --> 00:38:03.981
What do you mean I did it all, you jerk!

00:38:04.281 --> 00:38:06.051
- Get out here! - Hey...

00:38:06.191 --> 00:38:09.891
Hey! You spent my 3 million dollars on a house,

00:38:09.961 --> 00:38:12.091
and now you're trying to pin it all on me?

00:38:12.661 --> 00:38:14.561
- You jerk! - Grab him! Grab him!

00:38:15.131 --> 00:38:16.131
- Let me go! - Sir, please calm down.

00:38:16.201 --> 00:38:17.801
- Stop it, sir. - Let go!

00:38:18.801 --> 00:38:21.031
Get over here. Get over here, you jerk.

00:38:21.501 --> 00:38:23.701
Wait, hold on! What's this?

00:38:23.771 --> 00:38:25.201
- No, don't do it. - What is this?

00:38:25.271 --> 00:38:27.671
Don't! Stop it! Please, don't. Anything but this...

00:38:29.511 --> 00:38:30.541
You!

00:38:31.311 --> 00:38:34.751
Is your life all about lies and getting high, you jerk?

00:38:35.551 --> 00:38:36.581
You punk!

00:38:39.181 --> 00:38:42.351
Hey! I've had enough of this too!

00:38:47.361 --> 00:38:48.361
Mister!

00:38:48.961 --> 00:38:52.231
I've filed for fraud and embezzlement against him.

00:38:52.301 --> 00:38:56.171
The evidence and the complaint are in that yellow envelope.

00:38:56.241 --> 00:38:59.341
Evidence? Hey, what kind of evidence? You filed a complaint?

00:38:59.411 --> 00:39:01.071
You think I wrote it myself, you idiot?

00:39:01.141 --> 00:39:05.881
Someone much smarter than you wrote it. You darn con artist!

00:39:05.951 --> 00:39:07.581
You darn junkie!

00:39:07.881 --> 00:39:12.651
- You thug, Cho Pillip! - You're the thug, you jerk!

00:39:13.291 --> 00:39:16.021
And I'm submitting this as evidence too.

00:39:16.091 --> 00:39:20.391
He must have bought this with my money. This jerk.

00:39:20.461 --> 00:39:22.261
Look at him. He just can't quit.

00:39:22.561 --> 00:39:25.831
I've never seen a jerk like this. Just working out.

00:39:26.601 --> 00:39:29.101
(Labour Without Discrimination, Starting Now)

00:39:35.111 --> 00:39:36.111
My goodness.

00:39:36.181 --> 00:39:38.241
I'll help you bring it down, so you just need to finish the lift.

00:39:38.311 --> 00:39:40.781
Wait, you'll help me? Shouldn't I be doing it myself?

00:39:40.851 --> 00:39:42.381
And exhale.

00:39:42.981 --> 00:39:44.721
All right, good.

00:39:45.181 --> 00:39:46.191
Four.

00:39:46.251 --> 00:39:49.591
With all you trainers here, it feels just like being at the gym.

00:39:49.861 --> 00:39:51.961
I was upset that the gym closed,

00:39:51.961 --> 00:39:54.161
but I prefer working out outside now.

00:39:54.361 --> 00:39:56.961
I'm so grateful to you all for your trust and patience.

00:39:57.431 --> 00:40:00.631
So, what are we signing for?

00:40:00.831 --> 00:40:02.871
It's to protect employee rights and contracted labourers...

00:40:02.941 --> 00:40:06.611
Hate working and not getting paid? This is a law to stop that.

00:40:07.111 --> 00:40:10.341
Because the powerless have no one to help them when they're cheated.

00:40:10.681 --> 00:40:13.251
It's to make sure people get paid for the work they do.

00:40:13.411 --> 00:40:16.381
That's wonderful. We absolutely need a law like this.

00:40:16.451 --> 00:40:17.751
Come on, let's sign.

00:40:18.281 --> 00:40:20.021
- Here you go. - So Yeong!

00:40:20.091 --> 00:40:22.291
- Am I cool? - Come sign this.

00:40:22.351 --> 00:40:23.361
Yes, of course.

00:40:25.491 --> 00:40:27.791
- Look at this crowd. Hello. - Hey, you made it.

00:40:27.861 --> 00:40:28.861
Hey, Si On.

00:40:28.931 --> 00:40:30.231
Hello. the lady is here too.

00:40:30.301 --> 00:40:31.431
Hey, thanks for all your hard work.

00:40:31.501 --> 00:40:34.971
- So this is Mangheon City Park Gym? - You're here.

00:40:35.031 --> 00:40:36.101
Hello.

00:40:36.501 --> 00:40:39.611
I noticed during your trial that your core is incredibly weak.

00:40:39.711 --> 00:40:41.111
Who, me?

00:40:41.771 --> 00:40:43.011
He must be the one.

00:40:43.081 --> 00:40:47.011
Obviously, it's you. How strong can your tiny waist be?

00:40:47.211 --> 00:40:49.481
I seem to recall you two being pretty similar.

00:40:49.551 --> 00:40:50.721
What's that supposed to mean?

00:40:51.151 --> 00:40:52.321
I'm not even married yet.

00:40:52.381 --> 00:40:56.061
That's my point. An unmarried man with a weak core?

00:40:56.121 --> 00:40:58.191
Why'd you hit me? I'm telling you, it's still in mint condition.

00:40:58.261 --> 00:40:59.661
Mint condition? Yes, right.

00:41:00.061 --> 00:41:01.061
Come on over here.

00:41:01.131 --> 00:41:03.261
Let's focus on the core exercises today.

00:41:03.401 --> 00:41:06.401
You've got a real knack for escalating things.

00:41:06.931 --> 00:41:09.641
The citizens enjoy free training,

00:41:09.801 --> 00:41:14.171
and the trainers get protected. It's a win-win.

00:41:14.171 --> 00:41:17.581
- I heard you sold the equipment. - They first offered 30,000 dollars,

00:41:17.841 --> 00:41:19.181
but I sold it for 32,000 dollars.

00:41:19.241 --> 00:41:23.321
Didn't you just say it was stolen? I thought you didn't deal with that.

00:41:23.381 --> 00:41:26.651
It wasn't illegal. I got the ownership papers first.

00:41:26.751 --> 00:41:28.251
Same difference.

00:41:28.791 --> 00:41:32.491
And you "legally" blackmailed him into signing those papers.

00:41:32.621 --> 00:41:33.861
Blackmail?

00:41:34.591 --> 00:41:37.801
It's a negotiation technique for steering their choice.

00:41:38.801 --> 00:41:41.001
Without forcing their hand,

00:41:41.271 --> 00:41:43.771
you make them choose the path you've already laid out.

00:41:45.101 --> 00:41:46.571
How did you figure that out?

00:41:47.141 --> 00:41:49.681
It's not just a basic tactic, it's an advanced one.

00:41:56.851 --> 00:41:58.521
- See? I was right, wasn't I? - What?

00:41:58.521 --> 00:42:00.121
I'm telling you, he's a carbon copy of you.

00:42:00.891 --> 00:42:02.491
He's just as smug about it, too.

00:42:02.821 --> 00:42:06.131
"I guess you haven't heard of me. I'm Cho Philip".

00:42:07.891 --> 00:42:09.391
Oh, really? Is that what he said?

00:42:10.901 --> 00:42:12.361
Anyone who hasn't signed yet?

00:42:17.271 --> 00:42:22.011
They're workers in name only. They do the work of an employee,

00:42:22.071 --> 00:42:24.341
- but receive none of the benefits. - Hello.

00:42:24.411 --> 00:42:26.681
- Freelancers, gig workers, - Please take a look and sign this.

00:42:26.751 --> 00:42:30.351
And other independent contractors. Lee Seung Eun has the story.

00:42:30.651 --> 00:42:33.151
Oh! There it is. It's on.

00:42:33.951 --> 00:42:36.021
The gym trainers who recently had their wages withheld...

00:42:36.091 --> 00:42:39.421
have been helping people with their workouts...

00:42:39.491 --> 00:42:42.631
to protect the rights and interests of workers and service providers...

00:42:42.691 --> 00:42:45.161
while petitioning for a revised ordinance.

00:42:45.231 --> 00:42:46.501
(Proposed Ordinance for Maheon Workers and Service Providers)

00:42:46.571 --> 00:42:50.871
This ordinance covers freelancers and gig workers...

00:42:50.941 --> 00:42:53.941
What right do you have to speak for the citizens at City Hall?

00:42:54.011 --> 00:42:58.211
I went to meet Councilman Kwon. Of course I had to be the one to go.

00:42:58.281 --> 00:43:00.781
Would Kwon Bong Geun have been elected if it weren't for me?

00:43:00.911 --> 00:43:04.121
He represents the city, and I represent the citizens.

00:43:06.651 --> 00:43:07.651
Look.

00:43:07.791 --> 00:43:11.861
- You actually changed the law? - Not that I couldn't do it too.

00:43:13.161 --> 00:43:15.861
- That's actually pretty cool. - And you're really photogenic.

00:43:17.001 --> 00:43:18.001
Whatever.

00:43:42.451 --> 00:43:45.191
See if someone's waiting downstairs.

00:43:50.201 --> 00:43:51.461
What's going on?

00:43:51.931 --> 00:43:53.731
Ji Woo's phone is off.

00:43:54.431 --> 00:43:56.301
This has never happened before.

00:43:56.441 --> 00:43:59.301
What about her dorm? Have you contacted her friends?

00:43:59.401 --> 00:44:02.641
I can't reach her best friend, and she's not at her dorm.

00:44:02.711 --> 00:44:04.981
It's the middle of the day, so she should be in class, but...

00:44:05.541 --> 00:44:07.311
her exams ended last week,

00:44:07.651 --> 00:44:09.481
and she said she was taking this week off.

00:44:10.921 --> 00:44:11.951
I'm so sorry.

00:44:12.351 --> 00:44:14.951
- I'm sorry to bother you again... - No, no. You did the right thing.

00:44:15.251 --> 00:44:17.161
I'm glad Manager Bae called me.

00:44:17.761 --> 00:44:20.091
How long has Ji Woo's phone been off?

00:44:20.761 --> 00:44:25.401
I first tried calling five hours ago. We spoke last night before bed,

00:44:25.661 --> 00:44:27.501
so I think it's been off since this morning.

00:44:27.571 --> 00:44:29.331
Has this ever happened before?

00:44:31.441 --> 00:44:32.471
No.

00:44:32.871 --> 00:44:34.971
She's missed my calls before, but...

00:44:40.751 --> 00:44:41.751
Ji Woo?

00:44:43.481 --> 00:44:45.121
What happened?

00:44:45.621 --> 00:44:46.621
Is something wrong?

00:44:46.691 --> 00:44:50.121
Mom, I'm sorry. I forgot to charge my phone,

00:44:50.321 --> 00:44:52.121
and didn't even realise it had died.

00:44:52.861 --> 00:44:53.891
Kim Ji Woo.

00:44:54.191 --> 00:44:55.861
Do you have any idea how worried I was?

00:44:55.931 --> 00:45:00.831
I was out with Estelle. Her phone was dead too, so we couldn't.

00:45:02.201 --> 00:45:05.401
You two are unbelievable. I'll call you back later. Bye.

00:45:11.281 --> 00:45:14.311
- I'm so sorry. - Don't be. I'm glad she's okay.

00:45:32.061 --> 00:45:33.101
What are you doing here?

00:45:33.171 --> 00:45:35.471
What I do here is none of your business.

00:45:36.671 --> 00:45:37.971
What do you mean, it's none of our business?

00:45:38.701 --> 00:45:42.241
- You've spied on me. - I wasn't spying on you.

00:45:42.541 --> 00:45:45.641
- Come with me. - Get off me, you jerk!

00:45:47.551 --> 00:45:52.181
You're making a scene. Manager Bae, give our friend here a little shot.

00:45:53.591 --> 00:45:56.821
- A shot? What kind of shot? - One that'll shut you up.

00:45:57.391 --> 00:45:59.421
My friend here is very good with needles.

00:46:00.361 --> 00:46:01.591
Want a strong one?

00:46:07.371 --> 00:46:10.571
I'm going to kill that jerk today and then turn myself in.

00:46:10.801 --> 00:46:12.071
The feeling's mutual.

00:46:12.201 --> 00:46:14.811
Hey, once I find my item, I'll not come back here.

00:46:15.211 --> 00:46:16.211
Your item?

00:46:18.711 --> 00:46:20.651
Excuse me. I'm so sorry.

00:46:20.711 --> 00:46:24.021
Something urgent has come up, so I'm afraid I have to close.

00:46:30.121 --> 00:46:31.521
What's in this?

00:46:32.021 --> 00:46:34.361
What's it to you? What are you going to do?

00:46:35.761 --> 00:46:37.001
This is my meal ticket.

00:46:37.661 --> 00:46:41.031
Kim Yong Woo. How could you harm your kid's doll?

00:46:41.531 --> 00:46:44.001
- She almost died because of that! - Did she?

00:46:44.301 --> 00:46:45.301
But she didn't!

00:46:45.741 --> 00:46:49.941
You said this guy saved her. All I need is my item, and I'm done.

00:46:51.381 --> 00:46:52.381
How much is this worth?

00:46:54.811 --> 00:46:57.251
A few hundred grand?

00:46:57.521 --> 00:46:58.751
That money. Who's paying you?

00:46:59.051 --> 00:47:02.351
- So what if they are? - I'm asking who you have dirt on.

00:47:02.721 --> 00:47:07.361
You're sharp. How'd you figure out it was blackmail?

00:47:08.031 --> 00:47:10.101
Let's keep this simple.

00:47:10.201 --> 00:47:13.431
Once I find my item, I'll not come back here.

00:47:13.531 --> 00:47:15.301
You really think that item is still here?

00:47:16.171 --> 00:47:20.011
- What? - Lay low and stay out of sight.

00:47:20.271 --> 00:47:24.441
If I catch you hanging around, I'll hand you right over to them.

00:47:26.311 --> 00:47:28.951
Do you even know who "they" are to be making threats?

00:47:30.721 --> 00:47:33.691
I'll handle that my way.

00:47:34.691 --> 00:47:36.151
How about a shot before you go?

00:47:36.451 --> 00:47:37.461
Manager Bae.

00:47:38.561 --> 00:47:40.061
Seriously... Back off.

00:47:42.191 --> 00:47:44.761
He can barely take care of himself, and he's meddling.

00:47:49.031 --> 00:47:51.241
This isn't his first time, is it?

00:47:51.641 --> 00:47:55.171
Actually, he was here not too long ago.

00:47:56.411 --> 00:47:58.611
Ever since that man showed up,

00:47:59.141 --> 00:48:00.251
I've been worried about Ji Woo.

00:48:00.811 --> 00:48:02.051
So I've been a little on edge.

00:48:04.621 --> 00:48:05.621
Thank you.

00:48:07.421 --> 00:48:08.421
Of course.

00:48:19.161 --> 00:48:21.131
Everyone's speaking Korean!

00:48:21.701 --> 00:48:23.271
Are you sure you don't want to tell your mom?

00:48:23.941 --> 00:48:26.501
I'm going to surprise her after the concert later.

00:48:26.571 --> 00:48:29.171
Let's hurry and get some tteokbokki. Then the merch store.

00:48:29.341 --> 00:48:31.581
- The birthday cafe for the guys! - Totally!

00:48:33.041 --> 00:48:34.511
- Is that the bus stop over there? - Yes.

00:48:34.581 --> 00:48:35.581
Let's go!

00:48:40.391 --> 00:48:43.221
The Bazaar Resident Consent Form. I need it by next week.

00:48:43.891 --> 00:48:47.331
- I'll get it done, no matter what. - And one more thing.

00:48:47.631 --> 00:48:50.531
Hey, I thought this was a one-for-one deal.

00:48:50.731 --> 00:48:54.171
Hey now. You think an assistant's on my level?

00:48:55.731 --> 00:48:56.741
What is it?

00:48:56.901 --> 00:49:00.341
From now on, I want you to stick to Mr. Shin's side.

00:49:01.071 --> 00:49:02.511
I'm already on it.

00:49:02.811 --> 00:49:07.451
Do an even better job. When Mr. Shin is in danger,

00:49:07.751 --> 00:49:09.311
make sure you're right there with him.

00:49:10.281 --> 00:49:11.581
This is about Yun Dong Hee, isn't it?

00:49:12.551 --> 00:49:14.521
How would you know about that?

00:49:15.321 --> 00:49:17.221
I can put two and two together.

00:49:17.721 --> 00:49:19.461
A friend of mine from the Police University told me.

00:49:20.021 --> 00:49:21.261
And I saw the case file.

00:49:21.731 --> 00:49:23.831
The man who killed Jun has escaped,

00:49:24.501 --> 00:49:26.231
so Mr. Shin isn't just going to sit back and do nothing.

00:49:26.301 --> 00:49:29.171
You're smarter than I thought.

00:49:29.571 --> 00:49:30.841
That's a relief.

00:49:32.901 --> 00:49:34.841
What, you thought I was an idiot?

00:49:34.971 --> 00:49:36.981
No, it's just...

00:49:37.511 --> 00:49:39.381
I had my doubts.

00:49:42.511 --> 00:49:45.921
(Hujin Arcade)

00:50:02.631 --> 00:50:05.271
Once I find my item, I'll not come back here.

00:50:05.371 --> 00:50:08.341
Shut up. Bring me the item Kim Yong Woo stole.

00:50:10.681 --> 00:50:13.111
- How much is this worth? - A few hundred grand?

00:50:14.051 --> 00:50:18.381
Every time money enters his account, someone is going to die.

00:50:18.451 --> 00:50:21.621
Before Yun Dong Hee's doctor died, the last person she spoke with...

00:50:21.621 --> 00:50:23.191
was the director of the director of Federal Medical Center.

00:50:23.761 --> 00:50:27.931
Did you know Yun Dong Hee was going to be there?

00:50:35.571 --> 00:50:40.071
He's behind Yun Dong Hee's release, or he's the next target.

00:50:46.011 --> 00:50:47.681
I'm telling you, it wasn't me!

00:50:48.111 --> 00:50:49.211
I'm telling you I didn't do it!

00:50:49.281 --> 00:50:54.521
Mom...

00:50:54.991 --> 00:50:55.991
Why did it have to happen?

00:50:57.821 --> 00:50:59.291
Why did it have to be the same day?

00:51:11.227 --> 00:51:12.227
Mr. Shin, where are you going?

00:51:12.657 --> 00:51:14.857
- A delivery. - Where to?

00:51:19.327 --> 00:51:20.967
If President Sin's in any danger,

00:51:21.267 --> 00:51:22.697
you stick right by his side.

00:52:03.177 --> 00:52:06.147
I'll wait ten minutes. If he doesn't come down, I'm going up.

00:52:08.717 --> 00:52:11.187
Lee Heo Jun, a leading candidate...

00:52:11.247 --> 00:52:14.157
for Health Minister, has resigned as director of the FMC.

00:52:14.587 --> 00:52:17.657
While taking full responsibility for the recent inmate escape,

00:52:17.857 --> 00:52:21.257
he also blasted the staff shortages at the Federal Medical Center.

00:52:21.397 --> 00:52:24.327
A few days ago, I lost a cherished student...

00:52:24.667 --> 00:52:27.167
and a brilliant colleague.

00:52:28.337 --> 00:52:32.707
He alone cared for over a hundred forensic patients.

00:52:32.937 --> 00:52:35.337
And though he was suffering from overwork and stress,

00:52:36.037 --> 00:52:38.877
he never once let his patients see how much he was struggling.

00:52:42.717 --> 00:52:44.017
The working conditions at our hospital...

00:52:44.547 --> 00:52:45.547
and this incident...

00:52:47.117 --> 00:52:50.557
- Hey, you made it. - Hope I'm not interrupting.

00:52:50.657 --> 00:52:54.197
Not at all. Getting stabbed didn't kill me,

00:52:54.457 --> 00:52:57.397
but I was dying of boredom these past few days.

00:52:59.297 --> 00:53:00.297
Just kidding.

00:53:02.267 --> 00:53:03.837
You saved my life,

00:53:04.537 --> 00:53:06.137
and I haven't even had the chance to thank you properly.

00:53:07.507 --> 00:53:08.507
Thank you.

00:53:09.407 --> 00:53:10.707
Please. Don't mention it.

00:53:17.517 --> 00:53:18.587
I heard you were investigating...

00:53:19.017 --> 00:53:21.187
Yun Dong Hee for a long time.

00:53:21.357 --> 00:53:23.787
I have. Thanks to him,

00:53:24.187 --> 00:53:26.357
I've practically rewritten the book on police disciplinary actions.

00:53:26.597 --> 00:53:27.797
And I hear you visited our hospital...

00:53:28.757 --> 00:53:31.467
- several times. - Yes.

00:53:31.997 --> 00:53:32.997
Every time I went,

00:53:33.267 --> 00:53:35.367
your staff was never very cooperative.

00:53:36.507 --> 00:53:37.507
I figured this is...

00:53:38.107 --> 00:53:39.167
what you really came for.

00:53:41.477 --> 00:53:43.677
It's a copy of Yun Dong Hee's medical records.

00:53:45.047 --> 00:53:46.547
It's not much,

00:53:47.277 --> 00:53:48.277
but it's all I can do to help.

00:53:48.947 --> 00:53:51.587
(Forensic Patient Medical Record)

00:53:51.647 --> 00:53:53.417
(Yun Dong Hee Admitted: Sep. 20, 2010)

(Dept: Psych. Sex, Age: M, 40 Dr: Cha So Yeon)

00:53:54.557 --> 00:53:58.887
So the director has pull after all.

00:53:59.027 --> 00:54:00.657
I guess it's my turn...

00:54:01.327 --> 00:54:02.457
to rewrite the book on disciplinary action.

00:54:05.527 --> 00:54:08.467
- I'm kidding. - Hey, that's a sore subject for me.

00:54:09.767 --> 00:54:10.767
Not funny at all.

00:54:58.587 --> 00:55:00.457
- This is so good. - I know.

00:55:01.187 --> 00:55:03.527
Hey, dig in. I call dibs on the spicy drumstick.

00:55:03.757 --> 00:55:04.787
The original is good too.

00:55:06.897 --> 00:55:10.327
The person who brought this chicken, did you see which way hey went?

00:55:10.597 --> 00:55:11.597
I'm not sure which way he went,

00:55:12.127 --> 00:55:14.897
- but he just left. - Thank you.

00:55:15.437 --> 00:55:17.107
(Ward 21)

00:55:39.957 --> 00:55:43.827
You asked me if I knew Yun Dong Hee, didn't you?

00:55:44.527 --> 00:55:45.827
And you said you didn't.

00:55:47.897 --> 00:55:52.167
I was reviewing the inmate's file, and it turns out...

00:55:53.507 --> 00:55:54.937
we did have a connection in the past.

00:55:55.837 --> 00:55:58.447
About twenty years ago, at a juvenile detention center,

00:55:58.507 --> 00:56:02.517
I volunteered as a medical counsellor. Back then,

00:56:02.847 --> 00:56:04.717
I had a session with a young Yun Dong Hee.

00:56:07.587 --> 00:56:09.657
I wasn't intentionally withholding that information.

00:56:09.987 --> 00:56:11.427
Honestly,

00:56:12.027 --> 00:56:14.757
he was just one of many patients to me,

00:56:15.697 --> 00:56:17.567
and he didn't really leave a lasting impression.

00:56:17.897 --> 00:56:19.197
So I didn't remember him.

00:56:21.397 --> 00:56:22.667
Is that so?

00:56:23.137 --> 00:56:25.267
And I also confirmed...

00:56:26.167 --> 00:56:28.007
that you visit Yun Dong Hee...

00:56:28.637 --> 00:56:31.707
on the anniversary of your child's death.

00:56:32.977 --> 00:56:36.347
Frankly, a case like this is quite unusual,

00:56:36.447 --> 00:56:39.747
so I was wondering what your motivation might be,

00:56:40.057 --> 00:56:41.787
if you don't mind me asking?

00:56:48.227 --> 00:56:50.497
How could I possibly explain something like that?

00:56:53.567 --> 00:56:54.667
I suppose not.

00:56:55.167 --> 00:56:57.837
A parent's feelings after losing a child...

00:56:58.707 --> 00:57:01.477
are more than just simple sadness.

00:57:02.277 --> 00:57:04.877
A sense of loss.

00:57:05.647 --> 00:57:07.017
Sometimes, guilt.

00:57:07.517 --> 00:57:08.817
A sense of responsibility.

00:57:09.547 --> 00:57:11.787
And anger all get intertwined,

00:57:12.447 --> 00:57:13.917
creating a very complex...

00:57:14.587 --> 00:57:16.757
grieving process.

00:57:17.587 --> 00:57:20.927
I believe your repeated visits to the assailant...

00:57:21.127 --> 00:57:24.397
stem from one of those emotions.

00:57:26.767 --> 00:57:27.767
Then...

00:57:29.097 --> 00:57:31.337
What do you think my reason is?

00:57:33.977 --> 00:57:36.407
Atonement...

00:57:36.977 --> 00:57:38.207
for your late child.

00:57:38.907 --> 00:57:40.047
And...

00:57:40.717 --> 00:57:42.247
solace...

00:57:43.417 --> 00:57:44.417
for yourself?

00:57:51.927 --> 00:57:53.157
If by any chance,

00:57:53.827 --> 00:57:55.897
you ever need someone to talk to,

00:57:56.827 --> 00:57:58.167
please feel free to reach out.

I know all about it. And I want to help.

People could die. You might have to kill someone.

01:00:20.577 --> 01:00:23.077
It depends on the kind of revenge you're talking about.
