07:14.200 --> 07:15.620
<b>Everyone knows that.</b>

07:16.870 --> 07:20.830
<b>Looks like it's time to end our little chat.</b>

07:26.090 --> 07:27.090
<b>All right!</b>

07:28.710 --> 07:30.260
<b>Firing missiles!</b>

07:34.850 --> 07:35.970
<b><i>Metal Knight?</i></b>

07:38.560 --> 07:41.440
<b><i>I cannot fire with his missiles in the way.</i></b>

07:54.450 --> 07:55.870
<b><i>Amazing.</i></b>

07:55.870 --> 07:57.330
<b><i>Such destructive power.</i></b>

07:58.040 --> 07:59.410
<b><i>This hero is dangerous.</i></b>

07:59.410 --> 08:01.580
<b><i>I must be wary.</i></b>

08:11.340 --> 08:14.090
<b>Not quite potent enough, eh?</b>

08:15.800 --> 08:18.220
<b><i>33 seconds left until impact.</i></b>

08:18.850 --> 08:21.140
<b><i>To fire my incineration cannon at full power,</i></b>

08:21.140 --> 08:23.230
<b><i>I need five seconds to charge it with my body's energy.</i></b>

08:23.980 --> 08:27.310
<b><i>But the target is already close.</i></b>

08:27.690 --> 08:30.650
<b><i>And if I do take it out, what then?</i></b>

08:30.650 --> 08:34.070
<b><i>The meteor may break apart and still cause a disaster.</i></b>

08:34.070 --> 08:34.950
<b><i>But even before that,</i></b>

08:34.950 --> 08:36.950
<b><i>will my weapons be powerful enough to stop it?</i></b>

08:36.950 --> 08:40.330
<b><i>Even Metal Knight's countless missiles had no effect.</i></b>

08:41.330 --> 08:43.080
<b>First off, be calm.</b>

08:43.370 --> 08:45.620
<b>I see you've lost your composure.</b>

08:45.620 --> 08:50.420
<b>You are far too young to be worried about failure.</b>

08:50.420 --> 08:53.220
<b>When your back's up against the wall, just muddle through.</b>

08:54.010 --> 08:55.720
<b>The outcome won't change.</b>

08:55.720 --> 08:57.800
<b>So that's what is best.</b>

08:59.060 --> 09:01.220
<b><i>Muddling through is best...?</i></b>

09:10.190 --> 09:10.900
<b><i>He is right.</i></b>

09:12.280 --> 09:14.820
<b><i>If the outcome will not change...</i></b>

09:17.070 --> 09:20.990
<b><i>then I how can I die without giving it my all?</i></b>

09:22.750 --> 09:24.580
<b>Bang, get down!</b>

09:25.080 --> 09:25.920
<b>Oh.</b>

09:26.330 --> 09:29.340
<b><i>I will no longer think about failure or repercussions!</i></b>

09:29.340 --> 09:31.920
<b><i>I will just pour everything I have...</i></b>

09:31.920 --> 09:33.670
<b><i>...into one last shot!</i></b>

09:46.390 --> 09:47.560
<b>Dammit, is this not enough?!</b>

09:47.560 --> 09:51.320
<b>No! I think I see the meteor being pushed back.</b>

09:51.320 --> 09:52.940
<b>Really?</b>

09:52.940 --> 09:54.740
<b>Oh, no. It was just my imagination.</b>

09:54.740 --> 09:56.030
<b>You old fool!</b>

09:58.780 --> 10:01.700
<b><i>So this... will be my grave.</i></b>

10:12.840 --> 10:14.880
<b>Nine more seconds.</b>

10:14.880 --> 10:17.720
<b>Get out of here, Bang.</b>

10:17.720 --> 10:20.340
<b>Old man, take care of Genos.</b>

10:26.100 --> 10:29.350
<b>Who... who are you?</b>

10:30.150 --> 10:32.860
<b>I'm a hero.</b>

10:45.200 --> 10:46.290
<b>Sensei?!</b>

10:49.000 --> 10:50.790
<b>You're not...</b>

10:52.630 --> 10:54.300
<b>gonna fall...</b>

10:55.090 --> 10:56.050
<b>on my city!</b>

11:07.980 --> 11:10.100
<b>He shattered it!</b>

11:10.100 --> 11:12.020
<b>Unbelievable!</b>

11:12.020 --> 11:12.860
<b>But...</b>

11:23.240 --> 11:24.490
<b>It's collapsing...!</b>

11:25.450 --> 11:27.120
<b><i>It's not just this building.</i></b>

11:27.620 --> 11:31.750
<b><i>The destruction is spreading through the whole city.</i></b>

11:39.970 --> 11:41.720
<b>Guess that settles that.</b>

11:54.270 --> 11:56.770
<b>Three Days Later</b>

11:55.730 --> 12:00.440
<b><i>Although Z-City was able to avoid total destruction,</i></b>

12:00.440 --> 12:03.070
<b><i>the city was still devastated,</i></b>

12:03.070 --> 12:07.450
<b><i>with the effects of the meteor fragments visible everywhere.</i></b>

12:08.120 --> 12:10.790
<b>If only the Hero Association had called</b>

12:10.790 --> 12:13.040
<b>you to help instead of me, Sensei.</b>

12:13.500 --> 12:15.880
<b>If you had worked with Metal Knight,</b>

12:15.880 --> 12:18.550
<b>the damage could have been minimized.</b>

12:19.130 --> 12:21.170
<b>But that Metal Knight guy</b>

12:21.170 --> 12:23.090
<b>wasn't interested in helping, right?</b>

12:23.760 --> 12:25.640
<b>So stop worrying about it.</b>

12:25.640 --> 12:27.930
<b>I think we kept the damage to a minimum.</b>

12:27.930 --> 12:29.930
<b>After all, no one died.</b>

12:30.560 --> 12:31.890
<b><i>He is right.</i></b>

12:31.890 --> 12:35.690
<b><i>Sensei's punch killed the meteor's momentum.</i></b>

12:36.360 --> 12:39.070
<b><i>Theoretically, the shockwaves from the meteor</i></b>

12:39.070 --> 12:41.190
<b><i>would have annihilated everything.</i></b>

12:41.490 --> 12:43.990
<b><i>Stopping it was nothing short of a miracle.</i></b>

12:43.990 --> 12:45.910
<b><i>I would not be surprised</i></b>

12:45.910 --> 12:47.870
<b><i>if people talk about Sensei for years to come,</i></b>

12:47.870 --> 12:50.410
<b><i>praising him as a man of courage.</i></b>

12:50.410 --> 12:53.290
<b><i>But Sensei has no idea.</i></b>

12:53.290 --> 12:56.790
<b><i>Some of the public is even making him out to be the bad guy</i></b>

12:56.790 --> 13:00.000
<b><i>for causing the partial destruction of Z-City.</i></b>

13:01.340 --> 13:03.880
<b><i>No, I should not mention it.</i></b>

13:03.880 --> 13:05.010
<b>By the way.</b>

13:05.430 --> 13:08.300
<b>Do you think we moved up in ranking?</b>

13:08.300 --> 13:10.100
<b>Yes, we did.</b>

13:10.560 --> 13:13.310
<b>I went from Class S rank 17 to 16.</b>

13:13.310 --> 13:16.100
<b>Metal Knight also moved up from rank 7 to 6.</b>

13:16.520 --> 13:20.980
<b>Sensei, you shot up from Class C rank 342 to 5.</b>

13:21.820 --> 13:23.360
<b><i>Rank 5?!</i></b>

13:23.360 --> 13:24.900
<b>From 342 to 5?</b>

13:24.900 --> 13:27.950
<b>What the hell?! That's crazy!</b>

13:27.950 --> 13:29.160
<b>Not at all.</b>

13:29.160 --> 13:33.370
<b>Your performance was worthy of Class A or even Class S.</b>

13:33.370 --> 13:36.460
<b>After all, it was threat level Dragon.</b>

13:36.710 --> 13:37.710
<b>Yeah?</b>

13:37.710 --> 13:39.210
<b>If there had been no damage,</b>

13:39.210 --> 13:41.840
<b>I am sure you would be at Class S rank 5.</b>

13:43.260 --> 13:47.890
<b>Smashing the meteor alone was worthy of Class A.</b>

13:47.890 --> 13:50.930
<b>But I think the Hero Association assumed that</b>

13:50.930 --> 13:55.480
<b>Metal Knight and I played a bigger role.</b>

13:55.480 --> 13:58.150
<b>By the way, they always report threat levels</b>

13:58.150 --> 14:00.360
<b>as "demon" or "tiger" or whatever.</b>

14:00.360 --> 14:02.110
<b>Does all that mean anything?</b>

14:03.610 --> 14:04.610
<b>It does...</b>

14:04.610 --> 14:08.360
<b>Tiger: A crisis threatening massive loss of life.</b>

14:04.650 --> 14:08.360
Tiger

14:04.650 --> 14:08.360
Tiger

14:08.360 --> 14:11.370
<b>Demon: A crisis threatening to halt the functioning of an entire city,</b>

14:08.410 --> 14:13.370
Demon

14:08.410 --> 14:13.370
Demon

14:11.370 --> 14:13.370
<b>or cause its destruction.</b>

14:13.370 --> 14:17.000
<b>Dragon: A crisis threatening the destruction of multiple cities.</b>

14:13.410 --> 14:17.000

<b>God: A crisis threatening human extinction.</b>

14:17.040 --> 14:20.000

14:20.000 --> 14:22.710
<b>Wow... I had no idea.</b>

14:22.710 --> 14:25.550
<b>I believe heroes often consider threat levels</b>

14:25.550 --> 14:29.470
<b>when deciding to respond or not.</b>

14:29.760 --> 14:32.140
<b>But I guess they do not matter to you.</b>

14:32.140 --> 14:33.850
<b>Well, of course not.</b>

14:34.520 --> 14:37.180
<b>If the heroes run away, who's left to help?</b>

14:41.360 --> 14:42.690
<b>What are you doing?</b>

14:42.690 --> 14:45.320
<b>I must make a record of your words.</b>

14:46.240 --> 14:50.240
<b>Anyway, it wasn't all that much 
for such a huge jump in rank...</b>

14:50.910 --> 14:51.570
<b>All right.</b>

14:53.330 --> 14:55.330
<b>I'm gonna go out for a bit.</b>

14:56.290 --> 14:57.960
<b>You are going out, Sensei?</b>

14:57.960 --> 14:59.670
<b>I will come with you.</b>

15:00.040 --> 15:01.210
<b>You stay here.</b>

15:01.210 --> 15:04.170
<b>If something happens, you'll get all the credit again.</b>

15:11.760 --> 15:13.680

15:16.270 --> 15:16.930
<b>Oh.</b>

15:17.270 --> 15:19.770
<b>My favorite supermarket got smashed.</b>

15:19.770 --> 15:23.020
<b>And the crappy apartment building I got kicked out of is...</b>

15:23.020 --> 15:24.440
<b>Just fine... damn.</b>

15:25.820 --> 15:26.900
<b>Hey!</b>

15:28.320 --> 15:30.240
<b>You cheating bastard.</b>

<b>Uh... who are you?</b>

<b>You know damn well I'm Tank-Top Tiger!</b>

15:40.540 --> 15:43.080
<b><i>Seriously, who is this guy?</i></b>

15:44.420 --> 15:46.920
<b>You called me, little bro?</b>

16:05.360 --> 16:07.190
<b>What do you guys want?</b>

16:07.190 --> 16:09.320
<b>Huh? Isn't that obvious?</b>

16:09.320 --> 16:11.110
<b>To beat you up so bad</b>

<b>Hang on, little bro.</b>
