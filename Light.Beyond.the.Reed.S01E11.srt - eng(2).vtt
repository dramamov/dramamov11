00:01:44.851 --> 00:01:47.410
(Adapted from the Jinjiang novel
"Light Beyond the Reed" by Mo Shubai)

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:51.220
=Episode 11=

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:52.980
(Escort Passage, No Parking)

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:09.980
(Authorized Personnel Only)

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:56.850
Sibei.

00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:58.980
I'm going to court.

00:02:58.980 --> 00:02:59.850
Don't worry.

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:08.290
Nianwen.

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:10.170
This trial

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:12.820
affects not only my life,

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:14.260
but also Qin Nan's.

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:17.380
He might spend

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:19.380
his whole life
trapped in that lonely youth,

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:22.170
questioning the laws of this world.

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:25.220
Only if we win this case

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:27.850
can he find the answer he seeks.

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:30.380
Don't worry.

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:31.890
Trust the prosecution.

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:44.570
(Judge, Presiding Judge)
Nancheng People's Court.

00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:46.500
(Clerk)
Criminal Trial Division.

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:48.130
The court is now in session.

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:52.850
Bailiff, bring the defendant Fan Jiancheng in.

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:09.170
Thank you.

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:16.180
Stand up.

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:20.780
The prosecutor
will now read the indictment.

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:25.340
Nancheng People's Procuratorate's indictment.

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:28.980
(Courtroom 3)

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:30.410
Mr. Ye, Mrs. Ye.

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:32.290
If you need anything,

00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:33.580
just let me know.

00:04:41.730 --> 00:04:43.020
Wait outside for a while.

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:43.860
Okay.

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:47.540
(Public Waiting Area)

00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:48.780
Dad, Mom.

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:50.020
Sit here first.

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:51.580
I'll go out with Captain Zhang.

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:53.044
Call me if you need anything.

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:09.050
Captain Zhang, got a lighter?

00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:10.900
No smoking allowed here.

00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:20.180
Nervous?

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:21.740
Captain Zhang.

00:05:22.290 --> 00:05:23.730
Will our case

00:05:23.730 --> 00:05:24.570
be fine?

00:05:27.170 --> 00:05:28.170
Well,

00:05:28.170 --> 00:05:29.170
usually,

00:05:29.170 --> 00:05:31.410
once we send a case
to the procuratorate,

00:05:31.410 --> 00:05:33.290
the case is closed

00:05:33.290 --> 00:05:34.580
if they decide not to prosecute.

00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:36.460
That means it's over.

00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:38.810
If they review it

00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:42.410
and believe the defendant is guilty,

00:05:42.410 --> 00:05:44.050
they'll pursue criminal liability

00:05:44.050 --> 00:05:45.540
and send it to court.

00:05:45.540 --> 00:05:46.844
If the court rules not guilty,

00:05:46.866 --> 00:05:47.780
then we

00:05:47.780 --> 00:05:49.220
and the procuratorate

00:05:49.220 --> 00:05:50.511
did all that for nothing.

00:05:50.511 --> 00:05:52.610
So we'll win

00:05:52.610 --> 00:05:53.780
our case?

00:06:00.050 --> 00:06:01.100
Keep going.

00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:03.170
Keep going.

00:06:04.170 --> 00:06:05.622
You won't be disappointed.

00:06:07.410 --> 00:06:08.700
That's all I can say.

00:06:13.580 --> 00:06:15.540
But sometimes, persistence

00:06:17.700 --> 00:06:19.340
is harder than I imagined.

00:06:21.810 --> 00:06:22.780
And Sibei

00:06:24.220 --> 00:06:25.700
has suffered enough.

00:06:27.900 --> 00:06:29.410
On the night of April 9,

00:06:29.410 --> 00:06:31.410
Zheng Qiang from Wanfu Properties

00:06:32.340 --> 00:06:33.580
called me and said

00:06:33.580 --> 00:06:35.050
he agreed to discuss our cooperation.

00:06:35.580 --> 00:06:37.020
Zheng Qiang

00:06:37.020 --> 00:06:38.340
loves a lively crowd.

00:06:39.050 --> 00:06:40.540
Here. Come in.

00:06:40.540 --> 00:06:41.900
So I called the employees

00:06:41.900 --> 00:06:43.410
still working overtime

00:06:43.410 --> 00:06:44.580
to join us.

00:06:44.580 --> 00:06:46.460
For some reason,

00:06:46.460 --> 00:06:48.700
Zheng Qiang thought
Ye Sibei offended him

00:06:48.700 --> 00:06:49.930
during the dinner.

00:06:49.930 --> 00:06:50.900
Fan.

00:06:51.290 --> 00:06:53.810
Your employee is disrespectful to me.

00:06:53.810 --> 00:06:55.810
She's new here,

00:06:55.810 --> 00:06:57.580
not used to drinking occasions

00:06:57.580 --> 00:06:58.700
and can't handle alcohol.

00:06:59.340 --> 00:07:01.410
I tried to stop him but failed.

00:07:01.410 --> 00:07:02.410
During the drinking,

00:07:02.410 --> 00:07:04.220
Ye Sibei told me

00:07:05.220 --> 00:07:06.900
to take her home afterward.

00:07:06.900 --> 00:07:08.020
I agreed.

00:07:14.700 --> 00:07:16.050
When we got near her home,

00:07:16.050 --> 00:07:17.220
she said

00:07:17.600 --> 00:07:18.810
she didn't want to go home.

00:07:19.220 --> 00:07:20.460
She asked me

00:07:20.460 --> 00:07:22.540
to take her to the canola field.

00:07:23.050 --> 00:07:23.810
I asked her,

00:07:23.810 --> 00:07:26.290
"Why do you want to go there?"

00:07:26.290 --> 00:07:27.340
She said

00:07:27.340 --> 00:07:28.810
that her husband wants a divorce.

00:07:28.810 --> 00:07:29.900
She was upset.

00:07:29.900 --> 00:07:31.290
So I drove her

00:07:31.290 --> 00:07:33.020
to the canola field.

00:07:35.900 --> 00:07:37.020
Then she

00:07:37.020 --> 00:07:38.050
suddenly hugged me,

00:07:38.050 --> 00:07:39.930
saying she liked me.

00:07:39.930 --> 00:07:41.050
While talking,

00:07:41.050 --> 00:07:43.900
she took a condom from her bag.

00:07:44.580 --> 00:07:46.140
I lost control for a moment.

00:07:46.140 --> 00:07:48.580
And it happened.

00:07:50.700 --> 00:07:51.900
Defendant Fan Jiancheng.

00:07:52.340 --> 00:07:54.810
Your lawyer submitted new evidence.

00:07:54.810 --> 00:07:56.700
When were those photos

00:07:56.700 --> 00:07:58.020
and the recording taken?

00:07:58.020 --> 00:07:59.340
How did you take them?

00:08:01.410 --> 00:08:03.460
The photos and the video

00:08:03.460 --> 00:08:06.050
were taken during that incident.

00:08:06.050 --> 00:08:07.700
I took out my phone.

00:08:07.700 --> 00:08:09.540
She didn't object, so I filmed.

00:08:10.900 --> 00:08:13.020
Why did you record the video?

00:08:16.290 --> 00:08:16.930
Maybe

00:08:16.930 --> 00:08:19.810
we were both too excited. I...

00:08:19.810 --> 00:08:22.700
But once I calmed down later,

00:08:23.930 --> 00:08:25.140
I got scared.

00:08:25.140 --> 00:08:26.340
Because both of us

00:08:26.340 --> 00:08:27.460
had families, right?

00:08:27.460 --> 00:08:28.580
So I told her,

00:08:28.580 --> 00:08:30.410
just this once, never again.

00:08:30.930 --> 00:08:31.810
But she refused.

00:08:31.810 --> 00:08:32.890
She asked

00:08:32.890 --> 00:08:35.010
for 100,000 yuan,

00:08:35.010 --> 00:08:36.180
or else she'd tell people

00:08:36.180 --> 00:08:38.060
what happened.

00:08:38.060 --> 00:08:39.530
As you said,

00:08:39.530 --> 00:08:41.420
if the victim threatened you,

00:08:41.890 --> 00:08:42.530
why

00:08:42.530 --> 00:08:44.940
was she left alone in the canola field?

00:08:44.940 --> 00:08:45.890
Weren't you afraid?

00:08:47.010 --> 00:08:48.530
Afraid of what?

00:08:48.770 --> 00:08:50.340
I was furious.

00:08:50.340 --> 00:08:52.060
I really thought

00:08:52.060 --> 00:08:53.460
everything she said

00:08:53.460 --> 00:08:55.770
and everything that happened was fake.

00:08:56.220 --> 00:08:57.700
I thought she was scamming me.

00:08:58.010 --> 00:08:59.340
So I didn't agree

00:08:59.340 --> 00:09:01.700
and drove away alone.

00:09:01.700 --> 00:09:03.060
The next day, she called,

00:09:03.060 --> 00:09:04.820
saying she had called the police,

00:09:04.820 --> 00:09:07.010
but there was still room for maneuver.

00:09:07.010 --> 00:09:09.530
She asked me to reconsider it.

00:09:09.530 --> 00:09:11.700
I didn't do anything. I'm innocent.

00:09:11.700 --> 00:09:14.130
So I didn't agree to her demand.

00:09:14.130 --> 00:09:16.130
After the case
went to the procuratorate,

00:09:16.130 --> 00:09:18.420
the photos and videos you took

00:09:18.420 --> 00:09:20.420
were clearly in your favor.

00:09:20.420 --> 00:09:22.220
Why didn't you submit them earlier?

00:09:26.340 --> 00:09:27.700
Unless it's unavoidable,

00:09:28.130 --> 00:09:31.010
who'd show something like that publicly?

00:09:31.010 --> 00:09:31.940
Right?

00:09:31.940 --> 00:09:34.300
You said Ye Sibei seduced you

00:09:34.300 --> 00:09:35.940
and threatened you repeatedly.

00:09:35.940 --> 00:09:38.300
Since she threatened you once,

00:09:38.300 --> 00:09:39.890
why didn't you record her

00:09:39.890 --> 00:09:40.940
to keep proof later?

00:09:41.420 --> 00:09:43.060
I'm a man, after all.

00:09:43.530 --> 00:09:44.370
And...

00:09:44.530 --> 00:09:46.010
I'm partly

00:09:47.010 --> 00:09:48.010
to blame

00:09:48.220 --> 00:09:49.420
for this situation.

00:09:50.010 --> 00:09:52.340
Even if she tricked or scammed me,

00:09:52.340 --> 00:09:55.111
I never thought of suing her.

00:09:58.700 --> 00:09:59.610
When I first realized

00:09:59.610 --> 00:10:01.130
she was the victim,

00:10:02.420 --> 00:10:04.180
I actually resented her.

00:10:05.180 --> 00:10:06.940
I thought she was too weak.

00:10:07.890 --> 00:10:10.220
She was bullied yet stayed silent.

00:10:10.220 --> 00:10:11.977
She was even scared
to report to the police.

00:10:12.940 --> 00:10:15.130
It was when I heard
what she said in that video

00:10:16.060 --> 00:10:17.220
that I suddenly realized

00:10:18.420 --> 00:10:20.530
she might have suffered
in ways I never knew.

00:10:21.300 --> 00:10:23.180
I should have known her better.

00:10:23.180 --> 00:10:24.370
Whether she was weak

00:10:24.370 --> 00:10:25.250
or timid,

00:10:25.940 --> 00:10:27.700
I should have been more tolerant.

00:10:28.370 --> 00:10:29.820
I shouldn't have always told her

00:10:30.250 --> 00:10:31.490
to try harder

00:10:32.370 --> 00:10:33.700
and be stronger

00:10:34.700 --> 00:10:36.100
while doing nothing myself.

00:10:39.420 --> 00:10:40.260
Qin.

00:10:41.420 --> 00:10:42.940
Good, really.

00:10:43.266 --> 00:10:44.610
That's the right way to think.

00:10:47.300 --> 00:10:49.420
But only now do I understand

00:10:49.822 --> 00:10:51.530
that she didn't report to the police,

00:10:52.490 --> 00:10:53.700
not because she was weak,

00:10:54.820 --> 00:10:56.180
but because I was ignorant.

00:11:03.300 --> 00:11:04.370
I really had no idea

00:11:04.370 --> 00:11:06.370
what kind of hardships awaited.

00:11:08.530 --> 00:11:10.530
After we went through it all,

00:11:11.490 --> 00:11:12.700
being judged by others,

00:11:13.060 --> 00:11:15.100
seeing
all the ridiculous comments online

00:11:16.100 --> 00:11:18.180
and even now

00:11:18.820 --> 00:11:20.850
still anxious about the trial,

00:11:20.850 --> 00:11:21.980
I realized

00:11:22.866 --> 00:11:25.355
I might not have had the courage
to report to the police

00:11:27.180 --> 00:11:29.420
if I had known
it would turn out like this.

00:11:35.180 --> 00:11:37.300
But she knew all that

00:11:38.530 --> 00:11:40.300
and still reported it.

00:11:43.980 --> 00:11:44.820
You regret it?

00:11:48.980 --> 00:11:50.850
Sometimes I feel so lost.

00:11:53.060 --> 00:11:54.820
What's the point of holding on?

00:11:56.180 --> 00:11:57.820
If we lose this case,

00:11:58.490 --> 00:12:00.060
what's the point

00:12:01.180 --> 00:12:02.730
of everything we've been through?

00:12:10.250 --> 00:12:11.300
Ms. Ye rarely talks

00:12:11.300 --> 00:12:13.490
to others at the company.

00:12:13.490 --> 00:12:16.060
Her husband picks her up
after work every day.

00:12:16.420 --> 00:12:17.850
Sibei, aren't you leaving?

00:12:19.300 --> 00:12:21.370
I'll leave when I finish these.

00:12:21.370 --> 00:12:23.530
Her husband didn't come a while ago.

00:12:23.530 --> 00:12:24.730
Ms. Tao told me she secretly

00:12:24.730 --> 00:12:26.420
lent her brother
money to buy a house

00:12:26.420 --> 00:12:28.610
without telling her husband.

00:12:28.610 --> 00:12:30.420
He was furious when he found out.

00:12:30.850 --> 00:12:31.940
He wanted a divorce.

00:12:32.850 --> 00:12:33.980
Before leaving work that day,

00:12:33.980 --> 00:12:35.700
I wanted to clean early.

00:12:36.250 --> 00:12:37.300
Accidentally,

00:12:37.300 --> 00:12:38.700
I knocked her bag over.

00:12:39.250 --> 00:12:40.700
I quickly helped pick it up.

00:12:40.700 --> 00:12:42.820
When I crouched down to get it,

00:12:42.820 --> 00:12:44.250
I noticed her bag

00:12:44.250 --> 00:12:45.180
contained a...

00:12:45.180 --> 00:12:46.020
A...

00:12:46.250 --> 00:12:47.300
A condom.

00:12:48.180 --> 00:12:49.300
I felt embarrassed,

00:12:49.700 --> 00:12:50.940
so I left right away.

00:12:50.940 --> 00:12:53.820
When Zheng Qiang
urged Ye Sibei to drink,

00:12:53.820 --> 00:12:56.300
did the defendant stop him or go along?

00:12:56.300 --> 00:12:58.850
Mr. Fan tried to help her at first.

00:12:58.850 --> 00:13:00.300
We all wanted to help her.

00:13:00.980 --> 00:13:01.820
But

00:13:02.420 --> 00:13:04.250
Mr. Zheng was pushy.

00:13:04.250 --> 00:13:06.100
I just think

00:13:06.100 --> 00:13:08.250
drinking's just for the mood.

00:13:08.250 --> 00:13:09.850
(Witness)
I drink like this everywhere.

00:13:09.850 --> 00:13:11.490
You drink one, and I'll drink one.

00:13:11.490 --> 00:13:13.300
That's mutual respect, right?

00:13:13.300 --> 00:13:15.300
Once everyone's relaxed, it's fun.

00:13:15.300 --> 00:13:16.530
If everyone holds back,

00:13:16.530 --> 00:13:17.890
this meal...

00:13:20.940 --> 00:13:21.780
Well...

00:13:21.940 --> 00:13:23.980
What's the point of the meal then?

00:13:23.980 --> 00:13:26.820
(Defense)
How many glasses did Ye Sibei drink?

00:13:26.820 --> 00:13:28.610
About ten.

00:13:29.100 --> 00:13:30.700
That girl

00:13:31.180 --> 00:13:33.420
is just a young staff.

00:13:33.420 --> 00:13:34.980
Everyone toasted me

00:13:34.980 --> 00:13:37.100
one glass after another.

00:13:37.100 --> 00:13:39.490
She cunningly tried to dodge the drinks.

00:13:39.940 --> 00:13:40.780
Well...

00:13:41.180 --> 00:13:42.250
She disrespected me,

00:13:42.250 --> 00:13:44.180
so I couldn't let it slide.

00:13:44.180 --> 00:13:45.530
We just drank together.

00:13:45.530 --> 00:13:46.980
I made sure she drank.

00:13:47.980 --> 00:13:49.420
Sir, hands off.

00:13:51.940 --> 00:13:53.060
April 10th,

00:13:53.060 --> 00:13:54.730
5:49 AM.

00:13:54.730 --> 00:13:56.940
The 110 center got a call.

00:13:56.940 --> 00:13:59.180
She said she was trapped in a field

00:13:59.180 --> 00:14:00.300
and needed a coat.

00:14:00.300 --> 00:14:01.420
I rushed over.

00:14:01.420 --> 00:14:02.940
There's bodycam footage as evidence.

00:14:02.940 --> 00:14:04.180
She was hiding in the field.

00:14:04.180 --> 00:14:05.180
Pale-faced,

00:14:05.700 --> 00:14:06.940
shaking all over,

00:14:07.370 --> 00:14:09.180
unable to speak clearly.

00:14:09.180 --> 00:14:10.940
I sensed something was wrong,

00:14:10.940 --> 00:14:12.610
so I called my colleagues

00:14:12.610 --> 00:14:13.820
and notified forensics.

00:14:14.060 --> 00:14:17.100
Then, we took Ye Sibei to the hospital
for relevant examinations.

00:14:17.100 --> 00:14:18.420
To your knowledge,

00:14:18.420 --> 00:14:20.420
Ye's report at the time

00:14:20.420 --> 00:14:22.300
was that she needed a coat.

00:14:22.300 --> 00:14:24.850
She didn't report rape, right?

00:14:25.940 --> 00:14:26.780
Yes.

00:14:27.180 --> 00:14:29.700
What did the condom you saw look like?

00:14:29.700 --> 00:14:31.060
It was purple.

00:14:31.060 --> 00:14:32.420
Please take a look.

00:14:32.420 --> 00:14:33.260
Is this the one?

00:14:38.180 --> 00:14:39.180
Yes.

00:14:39.180 --> 00:14:40.940
Then, when she pointed out
that the defendant

00:14:40.940 --> 00:14:42.180
drove her home that day,

00:14:42.180 --> 00:14:44.820
did you hear it yourself
or from someone else?

00:14:44.820 --> 00:14:46.060
I heard it with my own ears.

00:14:46.060 --> 00:14:47.700
Remember

00:14:47.700 --> 00:14:50.370
to get me and Chuchu home safely.

00:14:50.370 --> 00:14:52.820
Don't worry. I'll get you two home safe.

00:14:52.820 --> 00:14:54.700
Mr. Fan, hurry inside.

00:14:54.700 --> 00:14:56.279
Mr. Zheng couldn't find
anyone to drink with

00:14:56.280 --> 00:14:56.820
and got anxious.

00:14:56.820 --> 00:14:57.530
Alright.

00:14:57.530 --> 00:14:58.490
Take care of her.

00:14:58.490 --> 00:14:59.420
Okay.

00:14:59.420 --> 00:15:02.180
That day, there were others

00:15:02.180 --> 00:15:03.420
besides the defendant

00:15:03.420 --> 00:15:05.060
who could take her home, right?

00:15:05.060 --> 00:15:07.370
Ms. Ye mentioned Mr. Fan would send her.

00:15:07.370 --> 00:15:08.700
Because Mr. Fan was the only one

00:15:08.700 --> 00:15:10.250
not drinking that night.

00:15:10.250 --> 00:15:11.340
So

00:15:11.340 --> 00:15:12.490
I didn't ask further.

00:15:12.490 --> 00:15:14.730
You took Ye Sibei's clothes,

00:15:14.730 --> 00:15:16.100
collected biological evidence,

00:15:16.100 --> 00:15:17.700
and did related tests.

00:15:17.700 --> 00:15:19.300
Why didn't you do a blood test?

00:15:20.180 --> 00:15:21.700
It's because I wasn't sure

00:15:21.700 --> 00:15:24.490
what she had gone through at first.

00:15:25.180 --> 00:15:26.180
We could only start

00:15:26.180 --> 00:15:27.700
with a physical examination

00:15:27.700 --> 00:15:29.420
to see if she was injured.

00:15:30.250 --> 00:15:32.300
It was when she requested

00:15:32.300 --> 00:15:34.060
a DNA test

00:15:34.060 --> 00:15:35.180
that I realized

00:15:36.180 --> 00:15:37.490
she had been sexually assaulted.

00:15:37.490 --> 00:15:38.820
Was this confirmed

00:15:38.820 --> 00:15:40.250
after the results came out,

00:15:40.250 --> 00:15:41.980
or did you believe it right away?

00:15:41.980 --> 00:15:44.060
I believed it right away.

00:15:44.060 --> 00:15:45.377
So you collected evidence,

00:15:45.400 --> 00:15:47.180
assuming my client was guilty

00:15:47.180 --> 00:15:48.700
from the start?

00:15:48.700 --> 00:15:50.420
But Ye Sibei's condition
was already clear.

00:15:50.422 --> 00:15:52.180
Yes or no?

00:15:54.530 --> 00:15:55.370
Yes.

00:15:56.940 --> 00:15:58.700
Because I couldn't lie to my conscience.

00:15:58.700 --> 00:15:59.777
- Alright.
- Ye Si...

00:16:00.060 --> 00:16:01.420
Your Honor, I'm done.

00:16:36.820 --> 00:16:37.660
Qin.

00:16:39.300 --> 00:16:40.610
Back then,

00:16:41.180 --> 00:16:42.060
there was a case here.

00:16:43.180 --> 00:16:44.420
The man's crime period

00:16:44.420 --> 00:16:46.180
was from 1993

00:16:46.180 --> 00:16:47.940
all the way to 2009.

00:16:48.820 --> 00:16:49.940
During that time,

00:16:49.940 --> 00:16:52.250
he raped dozens of women.

00:16:52.250 --> 00:16:53.180
Do you know

00:16:53.700 --> 00:16:55.511
why he was so bold?

00:16:55.940 --> 00:16:56.780
Why?

00:17:00.940 --> 00:17:02.300
Later, he told his lawyer

00:17:02.610 --> 00:17:04.700
that throughout all those crimes,

00:17:05.730 --> 00:17:06.810
no one resisted,

00:17:07.400 --> 00:17:08.980
and no one reported to the police.

00:17:08.980 --> 00:17:10.810
It almost cost the offenders nothing.

00:17:10.810 --> 00:17:12.180
Would he be afraid?

00:17:12.810 --> 00:17:13.700
Impossible.

00:17:14.180 --> 00:17:15.980
You can't expect a bad man

00:17:15.980 --> 00:17:17.730
to suddenly repent one day

00:17:17.730 --> 00:17:19.090
and lay down his knife.

00:17:19.090 --> 00:17:19.930
Such people,

00:17:20.420 --> 00:17:21.980
will only sharpen that knife

00:17:22.290 --> 00:17:23.860
if not stopped.

00:17:26.700 --> 00:17:28.940
Recently, there was a case online

00:17:28.940 --> 00:17:30.980
that caused a huge stir.

00:17:31.290 --> 00:17:32.180
Remember it?

00:17:33.180 --> 00:17:34.420
That missing girl.

00:17:38.940 --> 00:17:40.180
They found her later.

00:17:41.180 --> 00:17:42.530
She said nothing.

00:17:43.420 --> 00:17:44.420
She didn't dare to speak

00:17:44.940 --> 00:17:45.780
or report it.

00:17:46.090 --> 00:17:47.460
And the case

00:17:47.460 --> 00:17:48.730
just faded away.

00:17:53.380 --> 00:17:54.220
Ye Sibei

00:17:55.530 --> 00:17:56.860
is truly brave.

00:18:00.980 --> 00:18:02.090
She reported to the police.

00:18:03.180 --> 00:18:04.050
She stood firm.

00:18:04.980 --> 00:18:06.180
That's

00:18:06.180 --> 00:18:07.940
the greatest warning

00:18:07.940 --> 00:18:10.111
to those hiding in the dark,

00:18:10.288 --> 00:18:12.066
thinking they never have to pay a price.

00:18:15.730 --> 00:18:16.570
Qin.

00:18:16.940 --> 00:18:18.290
Everything you've done

00:18:21.090 --> 00:18:22.490
truly isn't meaningless.

00:18:33.940 --> 00:18:35.290
Ye Sibei, your turn.

00:18:57.700 --> 00:19:00.860
(Judge, Presiding Judge)

00:19:18.460 --> 00:19:19.740
(Legal Representative)

00:19:24.940 --> 00:19:26.010
Victim Ye Sibei.

00:19:26.460 --> 00:19:28.330
(Presiding Judge)
Please describe that day.

00:19:35.330 --> 00:19:36.460
My name is Ye Sibei.

00:19:37.010 --> 00:19:39.220
28 years old and from Nancheng.

00:19:40.940 --> 00:19:42.420
I was an accountant

00:19:42.420 --> 00:19:43.900
at Fuqiang Real Estate.

00:19:47.420 --> 00:19:48.420
That night,

00:19:49.511 --> 00:19:51.800
Fan Jiancheng
suddenly came back to the office

00:19:52.490 --> 00:19:54.980
and told us to attend a dinner.

00:19:57.730 --> 00:19:59.860
After dinner, he drove me home.

00:20:01.570 --> 00:20:02.980
He blindfolded me

00:20:03.730 --> 00:20:04.940
and threw me out of the car.

00:20:05.420 --> 00:20:06.700
Twenty.

00:20:08.700 --> 00:20:10.180
He told me to walk forward,

00:20:10.180 --> 00:20:11.220
counting to 1,000.

00:20:11.220 --> 00:20:12.330
Twenty-two.

00:20:12.330 --> 00:20:13.420
Or he'd kill me.

00:20:13.940 --> 00:20:15.140
I was terrified.

00:20:15.460 --> 00:20:16.770
Keep walking.

00:20:17.700 --> 00:20:19.090
Count to 1,000.

00:20:20.250 --> 00:20:22.250
If you turn around, I'll kill you.

00:20:23.730 --> 00:20:24.980
Twenty-six.

00:20:39.700 --> 00:20:42.180
After counting to 1,000,
I removed the blindfold

00:20:42.860 --> 00:20:45.180
and found myself in a canola field.

00:20:52.140 --> 00:20:54.620
(Defendant)

00:20:55.090 --> 00:20:55.940
Ye Sibei.

00:20:57.010 --> 00:20:58.180
Usually,

00:20:58.180 --> 00:21:00.860
you're well-behaved, right?

00:21:03.010 --> 00:21:05.460
Had anyone ever told you before

00:21:05.460 --> 00:21:06.530
that it's dangerous

00:21:06.530 --> 00:21:09.570
for girls to drink at night?

00:21:10.770 --> 00:21:11.700
Yes.

00:21:11.700 --> 00:21:14.700
As a well-behaved girl,

00:21:14.700 --> 00:21:16.220
why did you still go,

00:21:16.220 --> 00:21:17.666
knowing the risk?

00:21:19.010 --> 00:21:20.180
Do you mean

00:21:21.380 --> 00:21:23.530
a girl who drinks at night

00:21:23.530 --> 00:21:24.700
is guilty?

00:21:25.380 --> 00:21:26.770
You misunderstand me.

00:21:26.770 --> 00:21:28.010
I'm just curious

00:21:28.010 --> 00:21:31.380
what made you do it.

00:21:31.380 --> 00:21:33.090
In that situation,

00:21:33.940 --> 00:21:35.090
I was under pressure.

00:21:35.620 --> 00:21:37.460
Everyone was watching me.

00:21:37.460 --> 00:21:39.290
I felt that if I refused to drink,

00:21:39.290 --> 00:21:41.090
we might lose the deal,

00:21:41.090 --> 00:21:42.860
and all efforts would be wasted.

00:21:43.530 --> 00:21:44.570
Besides,

00:21:44.570 --> 00:21:46.700
many colleagues I trusted were there.

00:21:47.570 --> 00:21:49.490
I didn't feel it was dangerous.

00:21:49.490 --> 00:21:51.222
After the incident,
you called the police.

00:21:51.730 --> 00:21:53.420
Why did you say you were fine?

00:21:55.090 --> 00:21:56.940
Because my mother told me

00:21:59.290 --> 00:22:01.180
not reporting it would hurt me less.

00:22:03.980 --> 00:22:05.180
After calling the police,

00:22:05.180 --> 00:22:07.290
you called the defendant again.

00:22:07.290 --> 00:22:08.420
What did you say?

00:22:08.860 --> 00:22:10.140
I asked for leave.

00:22:10.860 --> 00:22:12.290
He was my superior.

00:22:14.700 --> 00:22:16.700
Do you carry condoms daily?

00:22:19.700 --> 00:22:20.220
No.

00:22:20.220 --> 00:22:20.860
Then why did you

00:22:20.860 --> 00:22:22.330
have one in your bag

00:22:22.330 --> 00:22:23.170
that day?

00:22:24.770 --> 00:22:25.610
Look.

00:22:25.980 --> 00:22:26.940
What are you doing?

00:22:26.940 --> 00:22:29.288
If you really run into a criminal,
you should offer it.

00:22:29.288 --> 00:22:30.940
Prevent disease, reduce harm,

00:22:30.940 --> 00:22:32.490
and increase survival.

00:22:32.490 --> 00:22:33.420
I'll put it in your bag.

00:22:34.420 --> 00:22:35.730
No, I don't want it.

00:22:37.860 --> 00:22:39.700
My colleague put it there.

00:22:39.980 --> 00:22:41.730
She said that if attacked,

00:22:41.730 --> 00:22:43.570
giving the condom voluntarily

00:22:44.730 --> 00:22:46.180
will increase survival odds.

00:22:47.380 --> 00:22:48.220
Understood.

00:22:49.180 --> 00:22:50.860
Who told you

00:22:50.860 --> 00:22:53.460
condoms increase survival odds?

00:22:57.180 --> 00:22:58.020
Ye Sibei.

00:23:00.180 --> 00:23:01.090
It was Chuchu.

00:23:06.180 --> 00:23:09.730
Before the defendant assaulted you,

00:23:09.730 --> 00:23:11.940
you gave him the condom, right?

00:23:12.420 --> 00:23:13.260
No.

00:23:15.220 --> 00:23:16.490
When I woke up,

00:23:18.180 --> 00:23:19.330
it was already happening.

00:23:20.140 --> 00:23:21.900
Did you see his face?

00:23:23.900 --> 00:23:24.740
No.

00:23:24.860 --> 00:23:26.460
You were blindfolded the whole time,

00:23:26.460 --> 00:23:28.900
so you don't know who he was?

00:23:29.570 --> 00:23:30.410
Yes.

00:23:33.700 --> 00:23:35.180
Please look at this photo.

00:23:45.700 --> 00:23:46.540
Impossible.

00:23:48.290 --> 00:23:49.180
This can't be.

00:23:53.180 --> 00:23:54.020
That's not me.

00:23:54.490 --> 00:23:55.700
It's not me!

00:23:55.700 --> 00:23:56.700
It is you.

00:23:56.700 --> 00:23:57.730
It's not.

00:23:57.730 --> 00:23:59.180
According to court evidence,

00:23:59.180 --> 00:24:01.420
the photo we provided

00:24:01.420 --> 00:24:03.180
shows you weren't blindfolded.

00:24:03.180 --> 00:24:04.620
Your eyes were open,

00:24:04.620 --> 00:24:06.180
looking at the camera.

00:24:06.180 --> 00:24:07.570
You were conscious.

00:24:07.570 --> 00:24:09.380
How do you explain that?

00:24:09.380 --> 00:24:10.330
I don't remember.

00:24:10.900 --> 00:24:11.380
No.

00:24:11.380 --> 00:24:12.140
That's not me.

00:24:12.140 --> 00:24:13.490
There's no way it's me!

00:24:31.140 --> 00:24:32.620
During the whole incident,

00:24:33.010 --> 00:24:34.290
did he hit you?

00:24:36.140 --> 00:24:37.220
Did you resist?

00:24:37.620 --> 00:24:38.460
I did.

00:24:38.460 --> 00:24:40.460
I scratched him and cried for help.

00:24:41.140 --> 00:24:42.220
So during the process,

00:24:43.180 --> 00:24:44.330
you screamed, right?

00:24:49.220 --> 00:24:50.570
Yes or no?

00:24:53.180 --> 00:24:55.290
Yes, he forced me to scream!

00:24:55.290 --> 00:24:57.700
He said he'd kill me if I didn't!

00:24:57.700 --> 00:24:59.620
Did you enjoy it?

00:24:59.620 --> 00:25:00.700
No!

00:25:00.700 --> 00:25:02.980
Your Honor, that question is irrelevant!

00:25:04.280 --> 00:25:06.490
Irrelevant questions are not permitted.

00:25:06.490 --> 00:25:08.010
Yes, Your Honor. Understood.

00:25:18.420 --> 00:25:19.260
Ye Sibei.

00:25:21.010 --> 00:25:22.180
You love your husband.

00:25:22.730 --> 00:25:24.700
You want to be with him forever, right?

00:25:26.730 --> 00:25:29.180
Your monthly salary
is 3,500 yuan, right?

00:25:30.010 --> 00:25:30.860
Yes.

00:25:31.770 --> 00:25:33.940
Your monthly salary is 3,500 yuan.

00:25:34.111 --> 00:25:35.711
You took a credit loan of 100,000 yuan

00:25:35.733 --> 00:25:36.900
to be repaid in four years.

00:25:36.900 --> 00:25:38.770
You pay 2,400 yuan every month,

00:25:38.770 --> 00:25:40.900
leaving only 1,100 yuan
for living costs.

00:25:40.900 --> 00:25:42.900
Yet your own mortgage

00:25:42.900 --> 00:25:44.090
is still not paid off.

00:25:44.940 --> 00:25:47.330
Your husband runs a car repair shop.

00:25:47.330 --> 00:25:49.010
Life isn't exactly easy.

00:25:49.010 --> 00:25:49.980
You love him.

00:25:49.980 --> 00:25:51.420
You want a life with him.

00:25:51.420 --> 00:25:52.570
Haven't you ever thought

00:25:52.570 --> 00:25:54.180
about your own future?

00:25:54.180 --> 00:25:55.020
Or do you

00:25:56.730 --> 00:25:57.980
have another plan?

00:26:01.180 --> 00:26:02.140
Your Honor.

00:26:02.140 --> 00:26:04.380
The defense's question
is beyond the case scope.

00:26:04.860 --> 00:26:07.010
Your Honor, I have no further questions.

00:26:13.290 --> 00:26:16.220
Bailiff,
please escort the victim Ye Sibei out.

00:26:23.330 --> 00:26:25.420
Please have Ye Sibei
leave the courtroom.

00:26:58.555 --> 00:27:02.888
(Defendant)

00:27:13.290 --> 00:27:16.090
Bailiff,
please bring the witness Chuchu in.

00:27:26.700 --> 00:27:29.490
Please describe
what happened that night.

00:27:31.180 --> 00:27:32.380
My name is Chuchu.

00:27:32.940 --> 00:27:35.090
I work in sales at Fuqiang Real Estate.

00:27:41.620 --> 00:27:43.940
Sibei, call me when you get home.

00:27:44.380 --> 00:27:46.420
Let me know you're safe. Bye.

00:27:48.730 --> 00:27:50.460
That's what happened that night.

00:27:51.770 --> 00:27:53.940
I got off the car before Ye Sibei.

00:27:54.420 --> 00:27:57.490
Your fiancé
is Ye Sibei's younger brother, right?

00:27:59.900 --> 00:28:00.740
Yes.

00:28:04.380 --> 00:28:05.980
Were you drunk that night?

00:28:06.380 --> 00:28:07.170
No.

00:28:07.290 --> 00:28:09.330
Was Ye Sibei drunk that night?

00:28:12.330 --> 00:28:13.170
She was.

00:28:13.460 --> 00:28:15.700
When you two separated,

00:28:15.700 --> 00:28:17.330
your statement says

00:28:17.330 --> 00:28:19.770
Ye Sibei was semi-conscious.

00:28:20.180 --> 00:28:21.940
May I ask how conscious

00:28:21.940 --> 00:28:23.333
she was?

00:28:23.355 --> 00:28:24.770
(Ye Sibei was already unconscious,)

00:28:24.770 --> 00:28:25.900
(and you left her in the car.)

00:28:25.900 --> 00:28:27.940
(Are you even human? Did you mean it?)

00:28:27.940 --> 00:28:29.460
(You're the same as the rapist.)

00:28:29.460 --> 00:28:30.730
(What kind of person are you?)

00:28:31.620 --> 00:28:33.140
(You hurt people like that.)

00:28:33.940 --> 00:28:35.050
(Wearing a short skirt)

00:28:35.050 --> 00:28:36.290
(- with big curls,)
(- Don't you feel guilty?)

00:28:36.290 --> 00:28:37.900
(- she's no good either!)
(- You have no conscience.)

00:28:38.620 --> 00:28:40.940
(- The accomplice must be punished.)
(- She's always drinking with men.)

00:28:40.940 --> 00:28:41.940
(Who knows what she's done
in private with those bosses?)

00:28:41.940 --> 00:28:43.900
(- Does she think no one knows?)
(- How ridiculous.)

00:28:43.900 --> 00:28:46.140
(- Darn accomplice.)
(- All kinds of people exist.)

00:28:46.140 --> 00:28:48.460
Chuchu, please answer the question.

00:28:59.980 --> 00:29:00.740
(You're a sinner!)

00:29:05.700 --> 00:29:06.540
(Chuchu.)

00:29:08.730 --> 00:29:10.220
(Are you feeling unwell?)

00:29:14.940 --> 00:29:16.420
I... I was remembering.

00:29:20.420 --> 00:29:21.380
That night's events

00:29:21.380 --> 00:29:23.180
were all a bit blurry.

00:29:24.010 --> 00:29:25.860
I just recall her rambling non-stop.

00:29:25.860 --> 00:29:27.570
Could she still recognize people?

00:29:28.570 --> 00:29:29.460
Yes.

00:29:30.940 --> 00:29:32.700
She talked all night long.

00:29:33.330 --> 00:29:34.330
Her logic was clear.

00:29:34.330 --> 00:29:35.900
She could make phone calls clearly, too.

00:29:37.090 --> 00:29:39.420
That's why I felt safe
leaving her in the car.

00:29:39.900 --> 00:29:40.810
I even told her

00:29:40.810 --> 00:29:42.700
to call me when she gets home.

00:29:43.620 --> 00:29:44.900
She could recognize people.

00:29:44.900 --> 00:29:47.420
She could speak clearly and logically.

00:29:47.420 --> 00:29:48.290
In other words,

00:29:48.290 --> 00:29:50.490
Ye Sibei was sober

00:29:50.490 --> 00:29:52.140
when you two separated.

00:29:55.180 --> 00:29:56.420
Please answer my question.

00:29:59.620 --> 00:30:01.380
Witness, please answer.

00:30:06.420 --> 00:30:07.260
Yes.

00:30:12.620 --> 00:30:15.860
During the whole time she was drunk,

00:30:15.860 --> 00:30:18.140
did her sobriety

00:30:18.140 --> 00:30:19.620
seem to get worse?

00:30:19.620 --> 00:30:21.010
No.

00:30:21.010 --> 00:30:22.460
After getting drunk,

00:30:22.460 --> 00:30:24.570
she said things she never said before.

00:30:24.570 --> 00:30:27.010
After vomiting,
she was more clear-headed.

00:30:27.010 --> 00:30:28.330
Was she usually like this

00:30:28.330 --> 00:30:29.460
after drinking?

00:30:30.090 --> 00:30:30.770
Yes.

00:30:30.770 --> 00:30:32.180
How much could she usually drink?

00:30:33.180 --> 00:30:34.180
About 80 ml.

00:30:34.180 --> 00:30:35.600
How much did she drink that day?

00:30:35.770 --> 00:30:36.730
Less than that.

00:30:36.730 --> 00:30:38.700
So her intake that day

00:30:38.700 --> 00:30:41.420
wasn't enough
to cause loss of consciousness?

00:30:42.010 --> 00:30:42.940
I don't know.

00:30:42.940 --> 00:30:44.940
You gave her a condom

00:30:44.940 --> 00:30:46.220
and told her

00:30:46.220 --> 00:30:47.770
it could increase

00:30:47.770 --> 00:30:49.066
her chance of surviving a rape

00:30:49.066 --> 00:30:51.180
when encountering a criminal,
didn't you?

00:30:57.010 --> 00:30:59.220
Chuchu, please answer my question.

00:31:15.180 --> 00:31:18.180
Witness Chuchu,
please answer the question.

00:31:28.380 --> 00:31:29.220
No.

00:31:30.555 --> 00:31:31.619
I never gave it to her,

00:31:31.620 --> 00:31:32.911
nor did I say anything like that.

00:31:37.460 --> 00:31:38.570
What are you saying?

00:31:38.940 --> 00:31:40.180
Tell the truth!

00:31:42.180 --> 00:31:43.490
Mind the court discipline.

00:31:44.700 --> 00:31:45.540
Sit down.

00:31:47.180 --> 00:31:49.380
Your Honor, I have no further questions.

00:31:49.380 --> 00:31:50.570
Prosecutor.

00:31:50.570 --> 00:31:52.860
Do you have any questions
for the witness?

00:31:52.860 --> 00:31:54.460
In your statement,

00:31:54.460 --> 00:31:55.860
you clearly said

00:31:55.860 --> 00:31:58.570
Ye Sibei was dazed
when you got out of the car.

00:31:58.570 --> 00:32:00.090
Why change your story now,

00:32:00.090 --> 00:32:02.755
saying she could recognize people
and make phone calls clearly?

00:32:03.860 --> 00:32:05.140
I thought it meant she was dazed

00:32:05.140 --> 00:32:06.570
if she kept talking.

00:32:06.570 --> 00:32:08.220
What exactly do you mean

00:32:08.220 --> 00:32:09.860
by saying she talked non-stop?

00:32:11.420 --> 00:32:13.900
When people drink too much,

00:32:13.900 --> 00:32:16.180
they say things they don't usually say.

00:32:16.900 --> 00:32:19.090
After she got drunk that day,

00:32:19.090 --> 00:32:20.900
she talked a lot to me.

00:32:20.900 --> 00:32:21.900
Normally, she's someone

00:32:21.900 --> 00:32:23.460
who rarely talks about herself.

00:32:23.460 --> 00:32:24.420
But that day she held me,

00:32:24.420 --> 00:32:26.730
talking about her family

00:32:26.730 --> 00:32:28.940
and how upset she felt.

00:32:40.090 --> 00:32:41.860
Your Honor, I have no more questions.

00:32:44.700 --> 00:32:47.620
Bailiff, escort witness Chuchu out.

00:33:50.490 --> 00:33:53.180
The victim claimed
that she was forced to cooperate

00:33:53.180 --> 00:33:54.460
and scratched my client

00:33:54.460 --> 00:33:56.220
throughout the incident.

00:33:57.420 --> 00:34:00.330
Everyone, look at the position
of the scratches in this photo.

00:34:05.490 --> 00:34:06.490
Isn't this

00:34:07.180 --> 00:34:09.900
why such scratch marks
were more likely to appear?

00:34:10.300 --> 00:34:11.740
So it's reasonable to suspect

00:34:12.090 --> 00:34:13.570
that such an intimate posture

00:34:13.570 --> 00:34:16.420
shows the victim cooperated.

00:34:16.420 --> 00:34:18.420
Prosecutor reminds defense

00:34:18.420 --> 00:34:19.940
that the court examines facts,

00:34:19.940 --> 00:34:21.420
not speculation.

00:34:21.940 --> 00:34:24.210
There's a time gap between the incident

00:34:24.210 --> 00:34:25.940
and the victim's injury assessment.

00:34:25.940 --> 00:34:28.170
But the scratches still remained,

00:34:28.170 --> 00:34:29.490
which shows

00:34:29.490 --> 00:34:31.420
the victim made a desperate struggle

00:34:31.420 --> 00:34:34.090
in an extreme situation.

00:34:34.090 --> 00:34:37.690
And the scratches being deep and messy

00:34:37.690 --> 00:34:38.940
further prove

00:34:38.940 --> 00:34:41.170
the victim fought back fiercely.

00:34:41.170 --> 00:34:42.690
But it's also possible

00:34:42.690 --> 00:34:44.860
they were caused
by sexual pleasure, right?

00:34:46.860 --> 00:34:47.780
Defense.

00:34:47.780 --> 00:34:50.170
Please do not interrupt
the prosecutor's speech.

00:34:50.860 --> 00:34:52.170
Prosecutor, continue.

00:34:53.900 --> 00:34:55.740
I emphasize again

00:34:56.010 --> 00:34:58.940
that the so-called scratches
from sexual pleasure

00:34:58.940 --> 00:35:00.420
are pure speculation.

00:35:00.420 --> 00:35:02.690
Defense should respect facts.

00:35:02.690 --> 00:35:05.460
The court should disregard such claims.

00:35:05.460 --> 00:35:08.690
(Prosecutor)
Record defense for disrupting order.

00:35:08.690 --> 00:35:10.010
My first statement is finished.

00:35:10.420 --> 00:35:12.570
Your Honor, I'll be careful later.

00:35:12.570 --> 00:35:13.410
I understand.

00:35:13.940 --> 00:35:15.340
Actually, what I wanted to say

00:35:15.780 --> 00:35:18.570
is that whether active or passive,

00:35:18.570 --> 00:35:20.010
the scratches in the photo

00:35:20.010 --> 00:35:21.300
strongly support

00:35:21.300 --> 00:35:23.570
that they were in an embrace.

00:35:24.340 --> 00:35:25.420
The victim claimed

00:35:25.420 --> 00:35:28.690
she never saw the defendant's face.

00:35:28.690 --> 00:35:30.130
But her eyes are clearly open

00:35:30.130 --> 00:35:32.300
in that photo.

00:35:32.300 --> 00:35:33.530
The victim's statement

00:35:33.530 --> 00:35:35.460
is completely inconsistent

00:35:35.460 --> 00:35:37.090
with the injury assessment and photo.

00:35:37.090 --> 00:35:38.340
I argue

00:35:38.340 --> 00:35:39.420
that a single photo

00:35:39.420 --> 00:35:41.210
only records a moment.

00:35:41.210 --> 00:35:44.170
Its authenticity and relevance
are doubtful.

00:35:44.170 --> 00:35:46.210
Without other supporting evidence,

00:35:46.210 --> 00:35:47.780
it cannot show

00:35:47.780 --> 00:35:49.210
the real situation then.

00:35:49.780 --> 00:35:52.490
Even a captured expression existing

00:35:52.490 --> 00:35:54.170
does not mean clear awareness.

00:35:54.860 --> 00:35:57.610
If the victim were fully conscious

00:35:57.610 --> 00:35:59.980
while looking at the suspect
taking photos,

00:35:59.980 --> 00:36:02.460
how could she show no instinctive shame

00:36:02.460 --> 00:36:05.260
or reaction to avoid the flash?

00:36:06.490 --> 00:36:07.980
Thus, I believe

00:36:07.980 --> 00:36:08.780
that this photo,

00:36:08.780 --> 00:36:11.740
where she seems calm and clear-minded,

00:36:11.740 --> 00:36:12.570
actually proves

00:36:12.570 --> 00:36:14.610
the victim had already
lost consciousness,

00:36:14.610 --> 00:36:16.300
showing no normal reaction.

00:36:16.940 --> 00:36:19.420
The victim was not fully conscious.

00:36:19.420 --> 00:36:22.130
Her usual tolerance exceeded 80 ml.

00:36:22.130 --> 00:36:24.460
All witnesses' statements,
including hers,

00:36:24.460 --> 00:36:25.530
confirm that day's amount

00:36:25.530 --> 00:36:28.260
was not enough for a full blackout.

00:36:28.260 --> 00:36:29.900
And witness Chuchu confirmed

00:36:29.900 --> 00:36:31.420
that when they separated,

00:36:31.420 --> 00:36:33.490
the victim could recognize people

00:36:33.490 --> 00:36:36.010
and make phone calls
logically and clearly.

00:36:36.010 --> 00:36:37.210
So the prosecutor believes

00:36:37.210 --> 00:36:38.740
the claim of confusion

00:36:38.740 --> 00:36:40.050
is unfounded.

00:36:40.050 --> 00:36:42.980
The victim was not fully conscious,

00:36:42.980 --> 00:36:43.929
which is supported

00:36:43.930 --> 00:36:45.860
not only by the evidence
submitted by the defense,

00:36:45.860 --> 00:36:48.300
but also
by other relevant case evidence.

00:36:48.300 --> 00:36:51.460
They've been examined in court.

00:36:51.460 --> 00:36:53.570
I think
there's no need for repetition.

00:36:53.570 --> 00:36:56.460
Also,
the voice recording evidence shows

00:36:56.460 --> 00:36:57.380
that the defendant

00:36:57.380 --> 00:36:59.266
accused the victim of extortion
on one hand,

00:36:59.311 --> 00:37:01.050
but bribed her through the company

00:37:01.050 --> 00:37:03.420
on the other hand,

00:37:03.420 --> 00:37:05.690
trying to make her change her statement

00:37:05.690 --> 00:37:06.820
and withdraw charges.

00:37:06.820 --> 00:37:08.900
Such actions show

00:37:08.900 --> 00:37:11.340
the defendant trying to cover his crime

00:37:11.340 --> 00:37:13.460
and attempting
to escape legal punishment.

00:37:13.460 --> 00:37:15.940
The fact
that the victim thought of recording it

00:37:15.940 --> 00:37:18.170
shows strong legal awareness,

00:37:18.170 --> 00:37:19.610
so it raises suspicion

00:37:19.610 --> 00:37:21.210
that she recorded it

00:37:21.210 --> 00:37:22.940
to threaten the accused.

00:37:22.940 --> 00:37:24.170
Her providing her recording

00:37:24.170 --> 00:37:25.260
to the authorities

00:37:25.260 --> 00:37:26.259
was her legal right,

00:37:26.260 --> 00:37:28.400
not an act of extortion,
as claimed by the defense.

00:37:28.422 --> 00:37:30.090
But aren't such contradictions

00:37:30.090 --> 00:37:32.050
common in this case?

00:37:32.520 --> 00:37:35.300
She said she had no awareness,

00:37:35.300 --> 00:37:37.260
yet her intake that day

00:37:37.260 --> 00:37:39.820
wasn't enough for a blackout.

00:37:39.820 --> 00:37:42.570
I call this speculation

00:37:42.570 --> 00:37:43.940
without a factual basis.

00:37:44.210 --> 00:37:45.780
Alcohol tolerance alone

00:37:45.780 --> 00:37:47.822
is not the sole standard
for judging awareness.

00:37:48.130 --> 00:37:49.860
Her unawareness

00:37:49.860 --> 00:37:51.420
was a fact.

00:37:51.420 --> 00:37:54.050
Footage outside the hotel shows

00:37:54.050 --> 00:37:56.130
she was helped into the car,

00:37:56.130 --> 00:37:58.300
unable to walk by herself,
after being drunk.

00:37:58.300 --> 00:38:00.610
It clearly shows
she was drunk and dazed.

00:38:01.260 --> 00:38:02.530
But witness Chuchu's

00:38:02.530 --> 00:38:04.610
latest in-court testimony shows

00:38:04.610 --> 00:38:06.130
that when they separated,

00:38:06.130 --> 00:38:08.420
the victim should've been sober,

00:38:08.420 --> 00:38:09.900
not what she described

00:38:09.900 --> 00:38:11.460
as loss of consciousness,

00:38:11.460 --> 00:38:13.300
nor total blackout.

00:38:13.610 --> 00:38:15.420
The credibility
of witness Chuchu's testimony

00:38:15.420 --> 00:38:16.170
should be

00:38:16.170 --> 00:38:18.380
assessed with all the evidence.

00:38:18.610 --> 00:38:20.460
(Defense)
In her statement,

00:38:20.460 --> 00:38:22.420
the victim never mentioned

00:38:22.420 --> 00:38:23.780
anything about condoms.

00:38:23.780 --> 00:38:25.460
But there was indeed a condom wrapper

00:38:25.460 --> 00:38:26.940
at the scene.

00:38:27.490 --> 00:38:28.420
The victim claimed

00:38:28.420 --> 00:38:30.900
Chuchu told her to take the condom,

00:38:30.900 --> 00:38:33.420
but Chuchu flatly denied it.

00:38:33.420 --> 00:38:34.780
The victim's statement

00:38:34.780 --> 00:38:36.940
is full of contradictions.

00:38:36.940 --> 00:38:38.820
So how truthful

00:38:38.820 --> 00:38:40.610
is her testimony?

00:38:40.610 --> 00:38:42.610
With such a contradictory statement,

00:38:42.610 --> 00:38:44.900
what exactly is the victim hiding?

00:38:44.900 --> 00:38:46.210
Is it the truth?

00:38:46.210 --> 00:38:47.130
Defense,

00:38:47.130 --> 00:38:49.420
please stop making wild speculations.

00:38:51.170 --> 00:38:52.820
(Judge)
Both sides, remain calm.

00:38:53.490 --> 00:38:55.980
Now, the prosecutor and defense

00:38:55.980 --> 00:38:57.780
shall proceed to the second argument.

00:39:03.010 --> 00:39:05.090
Your Honors.

00:39:05.090 --> 00:39:05.940
In this case,

00:39:05.940 --> 00:39:08.530
the defendant was the victim's superior.

00:39:08.530 --> 00:39:11.460
There was no ambiguity
between them before the incident.

00:39:11.460 --> 00:39:14.050
There's no basis
for voluntary sexual intercourse.

00:39:14.490 --> 00:39:15.610
On the day of the incident,

00:39:15.610 --> 00:39:18.260
there was improper urging to drink.

00:39:18.260 --> 00:39:20.380
As her superior, the defendant

00:39:20.380 --> 00:39:22.170
let it happen

00:39:22.860 --> 00:39:24.610
(Defendant)
instead of stopping it.

00:39:24.610 --> 00:39:26.740
Video and witness evidence show

00:39:26.740 --> 00:39:28.820
the victim was already drunk.

00:39:28.820 --> 00:39:29.610
Her mind was unclear,

00:39:29.610 --> 00:39:31.300
and her resistance weakened.

00:39:31.300 --> 00:39:33.610
The defendant
took the drunk victim alone

00:39:33.610 --> 00:39:35.900
to a canola field.

00:39:36.260 --> 00:39:37.820
He created an environment

00:39:37.820 --> 00:39:40.130
that was completely
closed and overpowering,

00:39:40.130 --> 00:39:41.530
causing the victim

00:39:41.530 --> 00:39:43.530
to have limited ability to resist,

00:39:43.530 --> 00:39:44.490
unable to fight back,

00:39:44.490 --> 00:39:46.010
unable to effectively resist,

00:39:46.010 --> 00:39:47.420
to be at the defendant's mercy,

00:39:47.420 --> 00:39:49.420
and subject to his assault.

00:39:49.820 --> 00:39:50.820
After the incident,

00:39:50.820 --> 00:39:52.420
the victim
immediately called the police,

00:39:52.420 --> 00:39:54.733
requested a physical examination
and preserved evidence.

00:39:54.860 --> 00:39:57.420
Though later
she retracted under pressure,

00:39:57.420 --> 00:39:58.570
that cannot deny

00:39:58.570 --> 00:40:00.170
the existence of the crime.

00:40:00.860 --> 00:40:02.780
Considering her accusations,

00:40:02.780 --> 00:40:05.780
documents, objects, expert opinions,

00:40:05.780 --> 00:40:07.570
and audiovisual evidence,

00:40:08.300 --> 00:40:09.610
the prosecution believes

00:40:09.610 --> 00:40:11.340
that the defendant Fan Jiancheng

00:40:11.340 --> 00:40:14.900
used violence, coercion, and other means

00:40:14.900 --> 00:40:18.090
to force sexual intercourse
against her will,

00:40:18.090 --> 00:40:20.610
violating Article 236
of the People's Republic of China's

00:40:20.610 --> 00:40:22.050
Criminal Law,

00:40:22.050 --> 00:40:23.340
constituting the crime of rape.

00:40:24.010 --> 00:40:25.740
The facts are clear,

00:40:25.740 --> 00:40:27.940
and he should be held criminally liable.

00:40:27.940 --> 00:40:29.980
We ask the court to rule by law.

00:40:31.090 --> 00:40:33.300
Your Honor, the prosecutor rests.

00:40:34.260 --> 00:40:37.420
Now, the defense
shall give their final statement.

00:40:40.860 --> 00:40:42.780
Your Honors.

00:40:42.780 --> 00:40:43.620
In this case,

00:40:44.090 --> 00:40:47.170
the victim sought a home loan
for her brother

00:40:47.170 --> 00:40:48.730
and used
my client's position in the company

00:40:48.733 --> 00:40:51.088
to falsify a salary certificate
before the incident.

00:40:51.490 --> 00:40:53.530
When her husband found out,

00:40:53.530 --> 00:40:56.420
their marriage began to fracture.

00:40:56.420 --> 00:40:57.740
It can thus be concluded

00:40:57.740 --> 00:41:00.780
that she and the defendant
had private contact,

00:41:00.780 --> 00:41:03.260
and she was in serious need of money,

00:41:03.260 --> 00:41:05.820
with motive to extort the accused.

00:41:05.820 --> 00:41:06.610
In this case,

00:41:06.610 --> 00:41:08.130
the defendant's statement

00:41:08.130 --> 00:41:10.090
matches other evidence overall,

00:41:10.090 --> 00:41:11.380
showing no flaws,

00:41:11.380 --> 00:41:13.090
while the victim's statement

00:41:13.090 --> 00:41:16.340
differs from witnesses
and physical evidence.

00:41:16.340 --> 00:41:17.570
Detective Lin Feng,

00:41:17.570 --> 00:41:19.940
out of sympathy as a woman,

00:41:19.940 --> 00:41:22.420
showed subjective bias in this case,

00:41:22.420 --> 00:41:24.780
making the evidence partial

00:41:24.780 --> 00:41:25.780
and unreliable.

00:41:26.170 --> 00:41:29.090
The prosecution's
conviction of my client

00:41:29.090 --> 00:41:30.420
lacks direct evidence,

00:41:30.420 --> 00:41:32.420
relying mainly on assumptions.

00:41:32.420 --> 00:41:33.860
But in common sense,

00:41:33.860 --> 00:41:37.340
the victim brought a condom that day.

00:41:37.340 --> 00:41:39.170
And her alcohol intake

00:41:39.170 --> 00:41:41.130
was not enough to cause a blackout,

00:41:41.130 --> 00:41:42.860
yet she claimed no awareness.

00:41:42.860 --> 00:41:45.980
Knowing her route
differed from Chuchu's,

00:41:45.980 --> 00:41:47.010
she knew

00:41:47.010 --> 00:41:49.170
she would be alone on the way,

00:41:49.170 --> 00:41:51.570
yet chose my client, an older man,

00:41:51.570 --> 00:41:52.610
to drive her home.

00:41:52.610 --> 00:41:54.530
Though she called police later,

00:41:54.530 --> 00:41:56.570
she didn't mention
sexual assault directly.

00:41:56.570 --> 00:41:59.610
She only filed
a second report days later.

00:41:59.610 --> 00:42:01.980
These actions defy common logic.

00:42:01.980 --> 00:42:03.860
Thus, the defense believes

00:42:03.860 --> 00:42:06.380
the facts are unclear
and the evidence is insufficient.

00:42:06.380 --> 00:42:07.170
We cannot confirm

00:42:07.170 --> 00:42:09.530
that my client committed rape.

00:42:09.530 --> 00:42:11.050
He should be acquitted.

00:42:11.460 --> 00:42:14.170
(Presiding Judge, Judge)
Your Honor, the defense rests.

00:42:16.050 --> 00:42:18.980
Does the litigation agent
have any additional statements?

00:42:24.420 --> 00:42:25.340
Your

00:42:25.940 --> 00:42:27.050
Honors.

00:42:27.050 --> 00:42:29.980
After the dinner
on the night of April 9,

00:42:29.980 --> 00:42:31.940
my client got into the defendant's car,

00:42:32.980 --> 00:42:33.820
and was taken...

00:42:38.610 --> 00:42:39.460
She was taken...

00:43:18.940 --> 00:43:19.820
Ye Sibei

00:43:21.010 --> 00:43:22.050
is my sister.

00:43:23.900 --> 00:43:25.900
She lived her life with great caution.

00:43:27.900 --> 00:43:28.740
She loved beauty

00:43:29.820 --> 00:43:31.570
but never dared to bare her arms.

00:43:32.380 --> 00:43:33.490
She liked makeup

00:43:34.570 --> 00:43:36.940
but never wore bright, bold colors.

00:43:37.940 --> 00:43:40.090
She rarely went out alone at night.

00:43:41.530 --> 00:43:43.860
Most times, she asked our dad

00:43:43.860 --> 00:43:45.260
or my brother-in-law to drive her.

00:43:48.090 --> 00:43:50.050
The clothes she wore when assaulted

00:43:50.050 --> 00:43:51.570
were her company uniform.

00:43:51.940 --> 00:43:53.420
She was always mindful of it.

00:43:53.420 --> 00:43:54.420
Even in summer,

00:43:54.420 --> 00:43:56.010
she'd cover herself with a coat.

00:43:56.940 --> 00:43:58.420
So on the day she called the police,

00:43:58.420 --> 00:44:00.610
she told them she needed a coat.

00:44:01.460 --> 00:44:03.420
Because that coat

00:44:04.090 --> 00:44:06.420
was a kind of sexual protection for her.

00:44:07.340 --> 00:44:08.420
When the coat was gone,

00:44:08.420 --> 00:44:09.900
she asked the police for it.

00:44:10.900 --> 00:44:12.860
That was her way of asking for help.

00:44:14.050 --> 00:44:15.300
She wanted to report it,

00:44:15.300 --> 00:44:16.340
but my mom stopped her.

00:44:16.340 --> 00:44:17.570
I stopped her, too.

00:44:17.570 --> 00:44:18.980
Because as a lawyer,

00:44:18.980 --> 00:44:21.300
I know such cases cause secondary harm.

00:44:22.340 --> 00:44:23.980
So she reported to the police

00:44:23.980 --> 00:44:25.490
and denied she ever did.

00:44:28.780 --> 00:44:31.380
But my sister
still chose to report again.

00:44:32.210 --> 00:44:33.490
It was not for money,

00:44:33.490 --> 00:44:34.900
nor to extort anyone.

00:44:35.260 --> 00:44:37.420
She just wanted justice.

00:44:39.460 --> 00:44:40.940
As a victim

00:44:41.610 --> 00:44:42.740
and a woman,

00:44:43.820 --> 00:44:45.380
facing something like this

00:44:45.380 --> 00:44:46.780
and choosing to report it

00:44:47.570 --> 00:44:49.460
already takes great courage.

00:44:50.380 --> 00:44:53.460
I believe justice
shouldn't erase her courage.

00:44:53.460 --> 00:44:55.460
She deserves justice.

00:44:59.570 --> 00:45:00.820
That's all from me.

00:45:15.940 --> 00:45:17.490
The courtroom debate is over.

00:45:17.490 --> 00:45:18.300
The panel

00:45:18.300 --> 00:45:21.260
will reach a verdict after discussion.

00:45:22.010 --> 00:45:22.940
The court is adjourned.
