00:15:59.800 --> 00:16:02.033
raise your arms sideways.

00:16:02.033 --> 00:16:04.867
Now, stretch out your arm.

00:16:04.867 --> 00:16:08.533
Let's see whose armpits look nicest!

00:16:08.533 --> 00:16:10.200
Oh, lovely.

00:16:10.200 --> 00:16:11.767
Wow, so beautiful.

00:16:11.767 --> 00:16:12.767
Oh, well done.

00:16:12.767 --> 00:16:16.533
'Long, long ago, when tigers used to smoke.'

00:16:16.533 --> 00:16:18.867
'In a small hut deep in the mountains.'

00:16:18.867 --> 00:16:22.833
'A widowed mother lived there,
raising her two young children alone.'

00:16:22.833 --> 00:16:27.667
'Every time she went to work,
she warned her children.'

00:16:27.667 --> 00:16:32.867
'Kids, when Mommy's not home,
never open the door for anyone.'

00:16:32.867 --> 00:16:36.167
'One day, their mother
did chores at a village feast.'

00:16:36.167 --> 00:16:38.467
'She received rice cakes as payment.'

00:16:38.467 --> 00:16:42.400
'Thinking of her children, she hurried home.'

00:16:43.233 --> 00:16:46.900
'I need to give these cakes to my babies quickly.'

00:16:49.333 --> 00:16:55.167
'But on the shadowy mountain path,
there was a tiger as big as a house!'

00:16:55.167 --> 00:17:00.233
'The tiger growled, raising its massive paws.'

00:17:03.367 --> 00:17:07.600
'Give me a rice cake, and I won't eat you.'

00:17:07.600 --> 00:17:09.500
'Grrr!'

00:17:10.167 --> 00:17:11.967
'Grrr!'

00:17:12.733 --> 00:17:16.600
'Trembling, the mother handed over the rice cake.'

00:17:16.600 --> 00:17:20.933
'The tiger ate the cake and slunk away.'

00:17:20.933 --> 00:17:22.200
'Phew.'

00:17:22.200 --> 00:17:26.667
'As the mother calmed her racing heart
and crossed the next hill,'

00:17:26.667 --> 00:17:31.967
'the tiger reappeared, baring its sharp teeth.'

00:17:31.967 --> 00:17:34.233
'Grrr!'

00:17:34.233 --> 00:17:39.033
'Give me a rice cake, and I won't eat you.'

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:44.867
'The sister became the sun,
and the brother became the moon.'

00:17:44.867 --> 00:17:48.800
'They lived happily ever after.'

00:17:51.700 --> 00:17:53.700
Strawberry Class, everyone.

00:17:53.700 --> 00:17:55.367
- Yes.
- Yes.

00:17:55.367 --> 00:17:58.933
If you're home alone
and a stranger asks to open the door,

00:17:58.933 --> 00:18:00.300
what should you do?

00:18:00.300 --> 00:18:02.233
- No.
- Never let anyone in.

00:18:02.233 --> 00:18:05.967
- I must never open the door.
- No.

00:18:05.967 --> 00:18:07.933
Never ever.

00:18:07.933 --> 00:18:09.433
Alright.

00:18:09.433 --> 00:18:14.467
This is Iseon Kindergarten's
unique interactive class!

00:18:15.233 --> 00:18:16.900
Strawberry Class.

00:18:16.900 --> 00:18:18.633
One, two, three!

00:18:18.633 --> 00:18:21.133
- Grrr!
- Grrr!

00:18:23.400 --> 00:18:25.367
What's going on?

00:18:26.900 --> 00:18:29.200
That was great, Miss.

00:18:30.500 --> 00:18:32.133
Sorry to interrupt.

00:18:32.133 --> 00:18:33.767
Ms. Bu Se Mi.

00:18:34.533 --> 00:18:36.167
Yes?

00:18:51.200 --> 00:18:54.033
Daughter! My daughter!

00:19:19.700 --> 00:19:21.833
Parents,

00:19:21.833 --> 00:19:24.000
our next class is physical education.

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:26.800
Please follow us to the Apple Classroom
with your children.

00:19:26.800 --> 00:19:28.200
Strawberry Class, move out!

00:19:28.200 --> 00:19:30.400
- Move out.
- Move out.

00:19:30.400 --> 00:19:33.467
Let's all do the pliés
we learned earlier as we go out.

00:19:33.467 --> 00:19:36.933
- Plié.
- Plié.

00:19:36.933 --> 00:19:39.033
Plié.

00:20:02.567 --> 00:20:04.567
Didn't you miss me?

00:20:15.233 --> 00:20:17.467
Yeong Ran.

00:20:17.467 --> 00:20:21.200
Do you know how hard it was
for Mommy to come here?

00:20:22.567 --> 00:20:24.167
Whoa!

00:20:26.933 --> 00:20:28.267
Yeong Ran.

00:20:28.267 --> 00:20:31.733
Shouldn't you worry about me
coming all this way like this?

00:20:31.733 --> 00:20:34.867
Is that how I raised you, Yeong Ran?

00:20:34.867 --> 00:20:37.400
Why are you rolling your eyes?

00:20:37.400 --> 00:20:39.300
Well, you are Madam now...

00:20:41.200 --> 00:20:42.900
Did Ga Seon Yeong send you?

00:20:42.900 --> 00:20:45.867
How did you even get here? Huh?

00:20:45.867 --> 00:20:47.233
See this? This?

00:20:47.233 --> 00:20:49.833
That witch Ga Seon Yeong did this to me.

00:20:49.833 --> 00:20:52.200
I thought I was going to die.

00:20:52.200 --> 00:20:55.967
I ran out without even having time
to dress properly.

00:20:55.967 --> 00:20:58.800
Ugh, this might leave a scar.

00:20:59.500 --> 00:21:02.700
How did you find out I was here? Huh?

00:21:02.700 --> 00:21:04.667
Yeong Ran.

00:21:04.667 --> 00:21:07.667
Only the back of your head was in the article,

00:21:07.667 --> 00:21:09.533
but I recognized you.

00:21:09.533 --> 00:21:11.200
Hey.

00:21:11.200 --> 00:21:13.967
Turns out I have maternal instincts too.

00:21:13.967 --> 00:21:16.067
So I decided,

00:21:16.733 --> 00:21:20.133
I deserve payback for raising you.

00:21:23.667 --> 00:21:25.700
As payment, ever since I became an adult

00:21:25.700 --> 00:21:28.867
I've been living to pay off
your debts day by day, haven't I?

00:21:28.867 --> 00:21:30.233
Isn't that enough?

00:21:30.233 --> 00:21:34.067
Thanks to that, you married
a man old enough to be your grandfather.

00:21:38.200 --> 00:21:40.933
I raised you that way,

00:21:40.933 --> 00:21:43.600
tough,

00:21:43.600 --> 00:21:46.567
so you'd survive anywhere.

00:21:46.567 --> 00:21:50.433
Your survival skills are all thanks to me.

00:21:53.200 --> 00:21:54.500
Ugh, I stink.

00:21:54.500 --> 00:21:57.567
I need a warm shower.

00:21:58.700 --> 00:22:00.233
What shower?

00:22:00.233 --> 00:22:01.867
Leave now.

00:22:04.800 --> 00:22:06.833
By the way, Yeong Ran,

00:22:06.833 --> 00:22:08.633
be honest.

00:22:08.633 --> 00:22:11.000
Why did you marry that old man from Gaseong Group?

00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:13.600
Even if you had nothing,

00:22:13.600 --> 00:22:17.900
it doesn't seem like you simply
married a man 40 years older than you.

00:22:19.033 --> 00:22:21.933
Did you get something in return?

00:22:21.933 --> 00:22:24.067
Or...

00:22:27.833 --> 00:22:30.733
Did you tell that old man to kill himself?

00:22:36.567 --> 00:22:39.000
Is that something a mother
should say to her daughter?

00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:43.100
I need to wash up.

00:22:47.267 --> 00:22:48.900
Any cafes here?

00:22:48.900 --> 00:22:52.200
After my shower, I need to down an iced Americano.

00:23:38.900 --> 00:23:40.700
You want to see me?

00:23:40.700 --> 00:23:43.433
- Secretary Han.
- Yes, Professor.

00:23:43.433 --> 00:23:46.867
Even if we sway the whole board, to be sure,

00:23:46.867 --> 00:23:49.000
we need Seon Woo's shares.

00:23:50.367 --> 00:23:52.467
Find Seon Woo by any means necessary.

00:23:52.467 --> 00:23:54.067
Understood.

00:24:05.367 --> 00:24:07.900
Mr. Jeon Dong Min.

00:24:07.900 --> 00:24:09.933
Mr. Jeon Dong Min?

00:24:11.267 --> 00:24:12.900
Miss.

00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:15.533
Oh, Ju Won.

00:24:15.533 --> 00:24:17.033
Where's your dad?

00:24:17.033 --> 00:24:19.967
He went to the village chief's house.

00:24:19.967 --> 00:24:22.767
Okay, got it.

00:24:22.767 --> 00:24:24.400
Miss.

00:24:25.167 --> 00:24:27.233
Give me your hand.

00:24:29.767 --> 00:24:31.400
Here.

00:24:35.333 --> 00:24:39.400
This is my favorite candy.

00:24:42.467 --> 00:24:46.133
When I'm feeling down, this makes me happy.

00:24:46.133 --> 00:24:48.367
You should try some.

00:24:50.667 --> 00:24:53.267
How did you know I was in a bad mood?

00:24:53.267 --> 00:24:55.833
Your mom showed up.

00:24:59.800 --> 00:25:02.933
I miss my mom too.

00:25:02.933 --> 00:25:06.200
But I might get angry if I see her.

00:25:06.200 --> 00:25:09.233
She left me and my dad.

00:25:09.233 --> 00:25:11.800
I totally understand how you feel.

00:25:17.433 --> 00:25:19.033
Ju Won.

00:25:20.233 --> 00:25:23.633
If one day I suddenly disappear,

00:25:23.633 --> 00:25:25.967
would you be angry then too?

00:25:30.467 --> 00:25:31.500
Miss.

00:25:31.500 --> 00:25:34.767
If you ever do go somewhere,

00:25:34.767 --> 00:25:37.567
promise you'll tell me, okay?

00:25:38.500 --> 00:25:40.267
Okay.

00:25:57.333 --> 00:26:00.067
Huh? Where are my slippers?

00:26:07.600 --> 00:26:09.533
Why is she wearing them?

00:26:25.767 --> 00:26:28.667
Friend, I'll just take three bills today...

00:26:28.667 --> 00:26:31.767
Wait, I'll only take four.

00:26:31.767 --> 00:26:33.567
Caught you, thief!

00:26:36.933 --> 00:26:38.767
I'm not a thief, old lady.

00:26:38.767 --> 00:26:41.767
This is what we call catching
someone in the act, you thief!

00:26:41.767 --> 00:26:43.733
And I'm not an old lady.

00:26:45.100 --> 00:26:47.167
But you are an old lady.

00:26:47.167 --> 00:26:48.567
You liar!

00:26:48.567 --> 00:26:50.633
What did you say?

00:26:50.633 --> 00:26:51.767
Nyah.

00:26:51.767 --> 00:26:53.733
Where are you running off to?

00:26:53.733 --> 00:26:55.367
Ow! You're stretching my clothes.

00:26:55.367 --> 00:26:56.900
- Give me the money and go.
- No.

00:26:56.900 --> 00:26:57.900
It's not yours.

00:26:57.900 --> 00:26:59.800
You're so noisy.

00:27:01.867 --> 00:27:04.067
Oh, Yeong Ran.

00:27:04.733 --> 00:27:06.767
My friend.

00:27:06.767 --> 00:27:08.333
That woman isn't really your mom, right?

00:27:08.333 --> 00:27:09.567
She's too suspicious.

00:27:09.567 --> 00:27:10.967
A friend?

00:27:10.967 --> 00:27:14.000
Since when do you call someone
who steals other people's money a friend?

00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:15.633
Yeong Ran, it's not like that...

00:27:15.633 --> 00:27:17.567
- I was...
- Ms. Baek Hye Ji.

00:27:21.267 --> 00:27:24.133
I need to talk to my mom alone.

00:27:24.133 --> 00:27:26.133
Could you step out for a minute?

00:27:29.367 --> 00:27:32.200
Is she really your mom? That woman?

00:27:32.200 --> 00:27:34.000
What are you saying?

00:27:36.500 --> 00:27:37.600
Yeong Ran.

00:27:37.600 --> 00:27:41.033
I was going to pay it all back with my savings.

00:27:41.033 --> 00:27:42.667
Fine.

00:27:54.300 --> 00:27:56.100
And don't wear my slippers!

00:28:02.633 --> 00:28:04.667
Yeong Ran.

00:28:04.667 --> 00:28:06.567
I like it here.

00:28:06.567 --> 00:28:10.667
I want us to live in the same room for a while,

00:28:10.667 --> 00:28:14.033
patch up the mother-daughter love
we couldn't build.

00:28:17.133 --> 00:28:18.467
What are you doing?

00:28:18.467 --> 00:28:20.133
You don't have my number.

00:28:20.133 --> 00:28:22.300
I'm trying to save it for you.

00:28:25.133 --> 00:28:26.733
That's true.

00:28:33.133 --> 00:28:34.733
Type it in.

00:28:43.567 --> 00:28:45.200
Here.

00:28:46.633 --> 00:28:48.433
By the way, Yeong Ran.

00:28:48.433 --> 00:28:52.800
Did Chairman Ga Sung Ho really commit suicide?

00:28:54.433 --> 00:28:56.567
What do you think?

00:28:56.567 --> 00:28:59.167
Why don't you guess, Mom?

00:28:59.167 --> 00:29:00.867
Ms. Bu Se Mi!

00:29:02.500 --> 00:29:04.100
Who's that?

00:29:05.133 --> 00:29:08.300
You have so many questions, Mom.

00:29:08.300 --> 00:29:11.233
Don't think about going anywhere,
and stay right here.

00:29:25.600 --> 00:29:29.700
Jeez, which side do I have to pick to make money?

00:29:36.333 --> 00:29:37.833
Why are you empty-handed?

00:29:37.833 --> 00:29:39.233
Weren't you going to give Hae Na a present?

00:29:39.233 --> 00:29:40.233
Oh, right.

00:29:40.233 --> 00:29:42.233
Dad, wait.

00:29:48.067 --> 00:29:49.700
Miss.

00:29:50.633 --> 00:29:52.667
Are you okay?

Do you need anything?

00:30:02.467 --> 00:30:05.600
Ju Won wanted to play with Hae Na,
so I'm going to drop him off.

00:30:05.600 --> 00:30:07.600
And for your mother...

00:30:07.600 --> 00:30:10.333
If she needs anything, I'll get it for her.

00:30:10.333 --> 00:30:12.600
It seems like she came here in a hurry.

00:30:12.600 --> 00:30:14.300
It's fine.

00:30:16.233 --> 00:30:20.033
Just call me if you need anything later.

00:30:20.033 --> 00:30:21.633

What's her real intention here?

00:31:39.367 --> 00:31:41.367
How did she find out where I am?

00:31:49.933 --> 00:31:52.833

Mom, do you want to go to the local store?

You seem to need a lot of things.

Earlier, you told me
not to move and stay put here.

For that kind of money...

You'd even drink lye if you have to.

Don't worry.

00:32:54.233 --> 00:32:56.900
My memory is amazing.

00:32:56.900 --> 00:33:01.233
The people who bought me
jade flooring or lent me money.

Did you know my daughter already?

00:34:03.133 --> 00:34:05.167
I first met her when she came to the kindergarten.

00:34:05.167 --> 00:34:08.200
My cousin is the principal here.

00:34:11.400 --> 00:34:12.967

I'm a farmer.

Farmers are wealthier these days, you know.

00:34:19.900 --> 00:34:21.733
You must own some land.

00:34:21.733 --> 00:34:24.533
I rent land to grow strawberries.

How young were you when you messed up?
You don't look the type.

Died in an accident.

00:34:45.200 --> 00:34:49.333
Without parents, what would
a child have to learn from?

00:34:51.133 --> 00:34:56.133
Did you also grow up without a mother,
without anyone to look up to, old lady?

What? You little brat.

Ga Seon Woo and electing a new CEO.

Please postpone the Seon Woo issue,

Today's meeting is sort of a request.

Though I'm asking for a favor,
I don't want to be pathetic.

Thank you for saving Ju Won.

00:56:00.533 --> 00:56:03.533
But don't rush at the car like that.

00:56:03.533 --> 00:56:05.700
You're not made of steel.

00:56:09.067 --> 00:56:10.733
What I'm saying is

00:56:10.733 --> 00:56:13.900
please think about yourself first.

00:56:17.067 --> 00:56:18.700
Okay.

00:56:21.200 --> 00:56:23.833
But are you angry?

00:56:23.833 --> 00:56:25.467
No, it's just...

00:56:29.400 --> 00:56:31.333
Yes, I'm angry.

00:56:38.733 --> 00:56:39.967
Then take this.

00:56:39.967 --> 00:56:42.333
It's candy for when you're angry.

00:56:49.200 --> 00:56:53.867
Anyway, you're really unpredictable.

00:57:06.900 --> 00:57:08.733
Miss!

00:57:17.100 --> 00:57:20.667
Dad, I'll take her home.

00:57:22.833 --> 00:57:25.367
Yeah, make sure you take her home.

00:57:25.367 --> 00:57:26.867
Okay.

00:57:26.867 --> 00:57:28.767
Let's go, Miss.

00:57:28.767 --> 00:57:30.600
I'm fine though.

00:57:40.733 --> 00:57:42.367
Ju Won.

00:57:45.733 --> 00:57:48.133
Can I ask you something?

00:57:50.700 --> 00:57:55.167
Did you follow someone earlier?

00:57:57.333 --> 00:57:59.067
Well...

00:57:59.067 --> 00:58:01.100
actually.

00:58:03.367 --> 00:58:05.567
I went alone.

00:58:08.267 --> 00:58:11.100
She really looked like my mom,

00:58:11.100 --> 00:58:13.600
so I followed her.

00:58:14.967 --> 00:58:19.667
Dad must've been really upset
because of me earlier, right?

00:58:23.900 --> 00:58:25.500
No.

00:58:27.333 --> 00:58:31.533
Ju Won, you really missed your mom, didn't you?

00:58:33.033 --> 00:58:39.700
Dad says Mom's studying in France,

00:58:39.700 --> 00:58:42.633
but I know that's not true.

00:58:42.633 --> 00:58:48.400
The neighborhood ladies said
Mom abandoned me and left.

00:58:51.233 --> 00:58:53.733
I really hate my mom.

00:58:55.000 --> 00:58:57.867
I don't like that lady either.

00:59:02.133 --> 00:59:04.267
Ju Won.

00:59:04.267 --> 00:59:06.500
I don't have a dad.

00:59:08.133 --> 00:59:10.367
But, you have

00:59:10.367 --> 00:59:12.600
an amazing dad

00:59:12.600 --> 00:59:15.500
who loves only you.

00:59:16.233 --> 00:59:18.833
I really envy that.

00:59:18.833 --> 00:59:20.467
That's true.

00:59:20.467 --> 00:59:23.033
My dad's the best.

00:59:25.233 --> 00:59:28.633
He's truly wonderful, right?

00:59:30.633 --> 00:59:34.267
Miss, I'm leaving now.

00:59:34.267 --> 00:59:35.867
Okay.

00:59:39.367 --> 00:59:41.600
Goodnight.

00:59:41.600 --> 00:59:43.533
Sleep well.

00:59:50.600 --> 00:59:52.500
Sleep well.

00:59:52.500 --> 00:59:54.600
You too, Miss.

01:00:06.522 --> 01:00:09.624
[Sujeong Hotel]

01:00:15.500 --> 01:00:17.733
[Ms. Bu Se Mi]

01:00:23.867 --> 01:00:25.400
Madam.

01:00:25.400 --> 01:00:28.067
It seems that the situation
might be resolved easily.

01:00:28.067 --> 01:00:29.700
What do you mean by that?

01:00:29.700 --> 01:00:32.133
Ga Seon Woo has something significant.

01:00:32.133 --> 01:00:36.200
If we secure that, your exile will end.

01:00:36.200 --> 01:00:38.300
Mom came to Muchang.

01:00:38.300 --> 01:00:40.633
Ah, so she went there.

01:00:40.633 --> 01:00:42.833
Attorney Lee, what do you mean by that?

01:00:42.833 --> 01:00:45.067
You knew all along and didn't contact me?

01:00:45.067 --> 01:00:47.433
Kim So Yeong isn't important right now, madam.

01:00:47.433 --> 01:00:49.100
Don't forget

01:00:49.100 --> 01:00:51.233
how much this game is worth.

01:01:08.600 --> 01:01:10.967
Where did he throw it?

01:01:27.567 --> 01:01:29.633
Darn it.

01:02:25.300 --> 01:02:27.167
It's been a while.

01:02:29.767 --> 01:02:32.267
I contacted you because I need a favor.

[Professor, I'll handle it soon]

01:04:33.033 --> 01:04:38.567
♫ Starting to be born again ♫

01:04:51.233 --> 01:04:53.800
♫ Now is the time ♫

01:04:53.800 --> 01:04:57.400
I want to look into the background of someone
who previously worked here.

01:04:57.400 --> 01:04:59.167
Seon Woo, where are you right now?

01:04:59.167 --> 01:05:00.767
Again, again, again!

01:05:00.767 --> 01:05:02.067
Sis, don't you remember that day?

01:05:02.067 --> 01:05:03.867
I'll just send this to Kim Yeong Ran.

01:05:03.867 --> 01:05:06.333
We might end this game quickly without bloodshed.

01:05:06.333 --> 01:05:07.700
She changed her identity?

01:05:07.700 --> 01:05:09.767
If Kim Yeong Ran dies now,
it'll complicate things.

01:05:09.767 --> 01:05:11.267
Why did you follow me last night?

01:05:11.267 --> 01:05:12.467
Are you spying on me?

01:05:12.467 --> 01:05:16.233
Then if that woman dies
instead of Kim Yeong Ran...

01:05:17.567 --> 01:05:21.500
Maybe it wouldn't be such a bad thing
for someone else to die.
