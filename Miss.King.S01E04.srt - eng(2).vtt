ROOK

00:00:11.241 --> 00:00:12.367
Stop…

00:00:14.077 --> 00:00:16.329
Stop playing shogi…

00:00:19.707 --> 00:00:20.542
Stop it.

00:00:23.545 --> 00:00:25.004
What's wrong?

00:00:26.881 --> 00:00:28.216
Stop playing…

00:00:32.637 --> 00:00:33.930
Stop playing shogi…

00:00:50.738 --> 00:00:52.073
Asuka.

00:00:52.699 --> 00:00:53.783
Asuka!

00:00:54.409 --> 00:00:55.869
Asuka!

00:01:08.131 --> 00:01:09.674
Are you okay?

00:01:12.594 --> 00:01:13.928
What happened?

00:01:18.099 --> 00:01:19.642
"Stop playing."

00:01:21.519 --> 00:01:22.395
What?

00:01:26.482 --> 00:01:28.526
"Stop playing shogi."

00:01:29.777 --> 00:01:30.612
A voice said so.

00:01:32.196 --> 00:01:33.072
Seriously?

00:01:33.156 --> 00:01:34.032
Shut up.

00:01:36.326 --> 00:01:37.619
All of a sudden…

00:01:39.037 --> 00:01:41.956
the words on the pieces
started to warp in front of me.

00:01:48.254 --> 00:01:50.048
Someone grabbed my hand…

00:01:53.176 --> 00:01:54.969
and I couldn't move.

00:01:57.972 --> 00:01:59.224
And then…

00:02:00.516 --> 00:02:02.393
The voice said…

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:05.688
"Stop playing shogi."

00:02:23.581 --> 00:02:27.001
That voice. Whose voice is it?

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:31.673
Who told you to stop playing shogi?

00:02:34.133 --> 00:02:38.638
When I play shogi,
everyone ends up miserable.

00:02:46.354 --> 00:02:50.233
Hey, cut that crap.

00:02:50.316 --> 00:02:53.194
Ghosts? Voices in your head?

00:02:53.277 --> 00:02:55.238
-What's this about, huh?
-Stop.

00:02:55.321 --> 00:02:57.281
You hesitated in that moment.

00:02:58.116 --> 00:03:02.245
You didn't know
how to handle the opponent's move.

00:03:04.372 --> 00:03:06.332
You know why all of this happened?

00:03:08.876 --> 00:03:10.878
It's because you're weak.

00:03:15.425 --> 00:03:16.718
Stop blaming others.

00:03:16.801 --> 00:03:20.471
You lost the winning line
because you're just weak!

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:23.307
Don't run away. I told you already.

00:03:29.856 --> 00:03:34.068
When you're in a match, think only about
the opponent in front of you.

00:03:37.613 --> 00:03:39.407
Mr. Todou. Ms. Reiko.

00:03:42.327 --> 00:03:44.746
You'll also be miserable
if you keep me around.

00:03:49.959 --> 00:03:53.838
Try making me any more miserable.

00:03:55.757 --> 00:03:58.009
You're such a drama queen.

00:03:58.092 --> 00:03:58.926
You fool.

00:04:09.645 --> 00:04:12.190
Sorry, he was out of line with you.

00:04:13.983 --> 00:04:15.443
He hasn't changed.

00:04:15.526 --> 00:04:18.780
He turns into a hopeless fool
when it comes to shogi.

00:04:20.907 --> 00:04:24.911
That's why he quit shogi.
Because of the stupid mess he caused.

00:04:25.536 --> 00:04:27.455
He never learns.

00:04:33.127 --> 00:04:34.212
Well…

00:04:36.964 --> 00:04:38.132
You know…

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:41.010
He punched Shoichi Yuuki.

00:04:54.315 --> 00:04:56.776
So, he had to leave the world of shogi.

00:04:56.859 --> 00:04:58.820
And look at his woeful state now.

00:05:00.696 --> 00:05:03.908
Why did he punch him?

00:05:05.827 --> 00:05:06.911
Right?

00:05:08.746 --> 00:05:11.040
You should ask him.

00:05:13.793 --> 00:05:16.546
Sorry to say this, but…

00:05:19.215 --> 00:05:21.175
I feel you two are alike.

00:05:22.427 --> 00:05:24.095
You and Seigo.

00:05:28.850 --> 00:05:30.768
I'll get you more water.

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:47.410
Put this piece here.

00:05:47.493 --> 00:05:49.078
Over here…

00:05:51.956 --> 00:05:52.999
Like this.

00:05:57.670 --> 00:06:01.299
CLASS 2-3 TODOU

00:06:22.612 --> 00:06:24.238
Good move.

00:06:25.406 --> 00:06:27.450
You're strong, Seigo.

00:06:48.554 --> 00:06:50.765
Dad? I won.

00:06:51.682 --> 00:06:53.351
I'm a kishi now!

00:06:53.935 --> 00:06:55.061
You did it!

00:06:56.437 --> 00:06:57.688
Congratulations.

00:07:15.623 --> 00:07:18.918
Dad. I'm in the Ohryu Title Match.

00:07:20.336 --> 00:07:22.588
I'll play against Yuuki Ohryu.

00:07:24.298 --> 00:07:26.467
You can do it…

00:07:28.177 --> 00:07:29.887
You can win the title…

00:07:31.055 --> 00:07:32.974
and become the Ohryu champion.

00:08:00.585 --> 00:08:02.962
Asuka? I'm almost done cleaning up.

00:08:03.045 --> 00:08:04.505
You can rest--

00:08:22.189 --> 00:08:24.900
Wait, wait, wait.

00:08:26.819 --> 00:08:29.989
Hey, not even a goodbye?

00:08:32.158 --> 00:08:33.492
I…

00:08:36.037 --> 00:08:37.872
I'm quitting shogi.

00:08:38.914 --> 00:08:39.999
How come?

00:08:41.792 --> 00:08:42.877
I…

00:08:44.003 --> 00:08:45.671
I just don't want to anymore.

00:08:48.549 --> 00:08:49.925
I see.

00:08:56.724 --> 00:08:58.351
Seigo did the same.

00:08:59.810 --> 00:09:02.521
After he punched Shoichi Yuuki,
he ran away.

00:09:03.939 --> 00:09:07.318
He acted like quitting shogi
was the end of his life.

00:09:08.611 --> 00:09:10.905
He shouldn't have punched him then.

00:09:13.407 --> 00:09:15.826
But he was also--

00:09:20.164 --> 00:09:21.957
Even if you quit shogi…

00:09:23.459 --> 00:09:24.960
you can still stay.

00:09:31.175 --> 00:09:32.176
It's okay.

00:09:33.761 --> 00:09:35.513
Thank you for everything.

00:09:40.142 --> 00:09:42.311
Come back anytime, okay?

00:10:16.011 --> 00:10:21.434
Rook on 2-4. Pawn on 2-3.
Knight promotes. Silver.

00:10:25.146 --> 00:10:26.230
ROOK

00:10:32.611 --> 00:10:33.904
Stop…

00:10:35.531 --> 00:10:38.075
Stop playing shogi.

00:10:39.410 --> 00:10:40.661
Stop it.

00:10:41.245 --> 00:10:42.788
Stop playing…

00:10:42.872 --> 00:10:43.998
Stop playing shogi…

00:11:30.377 --> 00:11:33.881
I'm sorry, Mom.

00:11:35.799 --> 00:11:36.884
I'm sorry.

00:11:51.524 --> 00:11:53.234
Here we go.

00:11:54.944 --> 00:11:56.987
Asuka left.

00:11:59.281 --> 00:12:00.824
So she ran away.

00:12:02.910 --> 00:12:04.828
You're running away too.

00:12:07.790 --> 00:12:10.292
You talked Asuka into it.

00:12:11.001 --> 00:12:15.589
Weren't you going to team up and
kill Shoichi Yuuki with shogi?

00:12:15.673 --> 00:12:20.678
And now you're giving up on her already,
after just stumbling a bit?

00:12:21.512 --> 00:12:23.264
Is your resolve that weak?

00:12:26.767 --> 00:12:29.979
Seriously. I can't take this anymore.

00:12:33.148 --> 00:12:36.443
I'm done with you and shogi. Leave.

00:12:38.153 --> 00:12:39.029
No.

00:12:40.364 --> 00:12:41.532
I mean it.

00:12:44.326 --> 00:12:45.786
What the hell?

00:12:48.247 --> 00:12:50.249
Until you bring Asuka back with you…

00:12:51.584 --> 00:12:52.835
don't come back.

00:13:03.929 --> 00:13:06.807
YUUKI

00:13:14.440 --> 00:13:16.317
-You're home.
-Hey.

00:13:16.400 --> 00:13:18.360
You left so quickly. Where were you?

00:13:18.444 --> 00:13:19.820
At the Shogi Association.

00:13:19.903 --> 00:13:20.946
I see.

00:13:22.615 --> 00:13:24.199
Is that Dad's old game record?

00:13:24.825 --> 00:13:29.121
No, this is Asuka's game
from today's Amateur Meioh Match.

00:13:32.666 --> 00:13:35.794
You see it too, don't you? Her style…

00:13:35.878 --> 00:13:39.757
She's a Central Rook player
just like your father used to be.

00:13:44.595 --> 00:13:47.222
Is she aiming to become a kishi?

00:13:50.225 --> 00:13:54.480
That can't be. A joryu kishi, maybe.

00:13:56.857 --> 00:13:59.860
Why? Is something wrong?

00:13:59.943 --> 00:14:03.280
Oh, right. You know her.

00:14:13.290 --> 00:14:14.625
She's my sister.

00:14:15.626 --> 00:14:16.460
What?

00:14:21.423 --> 00:14:25.177
Look. This is security footage from
Dad's Ho-oh Match.

00:14:26.011 --> 00:14:28.055
She's holding a knife.

00:14:28.138 --> 00:14:30.432
Is this Asuka?

00:14:31.225 --> 00:14:34.478
Yeah. Asuka Kunimi is Dad's…

00:14:36.397 --> 00:14:38.148
She's his previous wife's daughter.

00:14:40.859 --> 00:14:41.819
And…

00:14:44.196 --> 00:14:46.198
she tried to kill him.

00:15:11.890 --> 00:15:13.559
There you are.

00:15:13.642 --> 00:15:17.062
I heard you left.
But you didn't get too far, did you?

00:15:19.314 --> 00:15:22.026
I have nowhere to go.

00:15:24.194 --> 00:15:25.654
True.

00:15:45.591 --> 00:15:48.886
Hey, do you like shogi?

00:15:54.433 --> 00:15:58.103
Well, I don't. I hate it.

00:15:59.104 --> 00:16:01.815
I can't stop thinking about it,
no matter what.

00:16:01.899 --> 00:16:04.068
It's always there. It pisses me off.

00:16:06.945 --> 00:16:08.781
But playing is so much fun,

00:16:09.907 --> 00:16:11.617
so I can't quit.

00:16:13.368 --> 00:16:14.328
You're also--

00:16:31.053 --> 00:16:33.180
Why did you attack Shoichi Yuuki?

00:16:33.263 --> 00:16:36.266
What? Because I was pissed.

00:16:46.235 --> 00:16:48.695
The day before the Ohryu Match with him,

00:16:49.822 --> 00:16:51.115
my dad died.

00:16:54.409 --> 00:16:57.204
My state of mind was an absolute mess.

00:17:11.176 --> 00:17:12.511
I resign.

00:17:20.894 --> 00:17:25.023
I apologize for playing
such a pathetic game.

00:17:27.359 --> 00:17:28.193
Actually…

00:17:30.320 --> 00:17:32.573
my father passed away last night.

00:17:34.658 --> 00:17:41.373
He was really looking forward
to my game with you, sir.

00:17:43.292 --> 00:17:46.170
I wanted to give my best for him, but…

00:17:48.922 --> 00:17:50.340
Mr. Yuuki…

00:17:51.550 --> 00:17:54.052
I was honored to challenge you
in this Ohryu Match.

00:17:56.346 --> 00:17:58.348
My father would've been happy.

00:18:00.809 --> 00:18:03.604
I promise I'll be better next--

00:18:03.687 --> 00:18:04.980
You…

00:18:07.900 --> 00:18:10.110
You're not cut out for shogi.

00:18:13.113 --> 00:18:13.947
What?

00:18:17.367 --> 00:18:19.036
I'm so sorry…

00:18:21.747 --> 00:18:23.165
about your father.

00:18:26.126 --> 00:18:27.920
You're strong, Seigo.

00:18:28.003 --> 00:18:29.630
I'm a kishi now!

00:18:29.713 --> 00:18:32.132
You can do it…

00:18:32.216 --> 00:18:34.843
You can win the title and
become the Ohryu champion.

00:18:40.015 --> 00:18:42.851
-Mr. Todou!
-Mr. Yuuki! Are you alright?

00:18:42.935 --> 00:18:44.478
-Sir.
-Please stop!

00:18:44.561 --> 00:18:45.729
Calm down!

00:18:45.812 --> 00:18:47.105
Mr. Todou!

00:18:55.989 --> 00:18:59.034
And you quit shogi?

00:19:01.203 --> 00:19:03.372
He was right after all.

00:19:05.165 --> 00:19:06.166
How lame is that?

00:19:06.250 --> 00:19:07.167
Very lame.

00:19:10.003 --> 00:19:14.174
What about you?
You play shogi in constant fear.

00:19:14.258 --> 00:19:15.801
That's lame too.

00:19:28.188 --> 00:19:29.982
After he left us…

00:19:31.900 --> 00:19:33.902
whenever I played shogi…

00:19:35.404 --> 00:19:37.614
my mom looked pained.

00:19:42.244 --> 00:19:43.745
That's why…

00:19:45.872 --> 00:19:47.749
I quit playing.

00:19:54.089 --> 00:19:55.257
At the tournament…

00:19:56.758 --> 00:19:58.385
My opponent…

00:20:00.595 --> 00:20:01.847
His face…

00:20:04.558 --> 00:20:06.184
turned into Mom's.

00:20:19.031 --> 00:20:20.449
I see.

00:20:28.165 --> 00:20:32.127
That's nice. You get to see her ghost.

00:20:34.713 --> 00:20:36.923
Unlike me.

00:20:38.508 --> 00:20:44.765
I bet your mom came back
as a ghost to cheer you on.

00:20:47.517 --> 00:20:49.019
Just saying.

00:21:20.675 --> 00:21:24.221
Apparently, we are alike.

00:21:25.514 --> 00:21:26.515
What?

00:21:27.557 --> 00:21:29.267
Ms. Reiko told me.

00:21:30.310 --> 00:21:31.436
How?

00:21:32.604 --> 00:21:34.022
I don't know.

00:21:36.858 --> 00:21:42.072
Oh, but we have this in common.
Reiko kicked us both out.

00:21:42.155 --> 00:21:44.241
No, she didn't kick me out.

00:21:44.324 --> 00:21:45.742
Oh, really?

00:22:03.176 --> 00:22:05.470
Hey, where are you going?

00:22:05.554 --> 00:22:11.101
Back to Ms. Reiko's.
She told me to come back anytime.

00:22:11.184 --> 00:22:13.478
Great. I'll tag along too.

00:22:13.562 --> 00:22:15.230
Are you allowed back?

00:22:15.313 --> 00:22:17.107
Yes. With you I am.

00:22:19.443 --> 00:22:21.570
Alright. Want to play when we get back?

00:22:22.571 --> 00:22:23.822
Nope.

00:22:59.566 --> 00:23:01.359
Do you not want me to play shogi?

00:23:03.236 --> 00:23:04.070
Mom…

00:23:15.624 --> 00:23:22.505
ROOK

00:23:59.793 --> 00:24:00.919
Wake up.

00:24:02.504 --> 00:24:03.838
I'm awake.

00:24:05.423 --> 00:24:06.675
Let's go then.

00:24:17.727 --> 00:24:19.437
My dad's ashes.

00:24:58.852 --> 00:24:59.686
I…

00:25:01.146 --> 00:25:06.109
I blamed it on my dad
when I lost against Shoichi Yuuki.

00:25:08.820 --> 00:25:11.072
I put a curse on myself…

00:25:11.656 --> 00:25:13.116
and I ran.

00:25:22.917 --> 00:25:24.794
I lost because I was too weak.

00:25:41.353 --> 00:25:45.273
Try making me any more miserable.

00:25:57.911 --> 00:25:59.204
I'm sorry.

00:26:01.998 --> 00:26:03.166
Dad.

00:26:14.803 --> 00:26:17.972
Hey, Asuka Kunimi.

00:26:19.641 --> 00:26:21.434
You are strong.

00:26:24.396 --> 00:26:26.106
You'll get even stronger.

00:26:29.234 --> 00:26:33.405
From now on, we are here to support you.

00:26:33.488 --> 00:26:36.866
I promise, we'll get you stronger.

00:26:39.369 --> 00:26:41.538
Forget what your mom wanted.

00:26:41.621 --> 00:26:43.206
It's your life.

00:26:45.959 --> 00:26:48.628
It's too early to resign.

00:27:27.250 --> 00:27:30.587
Hey, that's my dad!
Why did you scatter him?

00:27:33.673 --> 00:27:34.757
I don't know!

00:27:34.841 --> 00:27:36.092
What?!

00:28:25.975 --> 00:28:27.310
Welcome home.

00:28:38.822 --> 00:28:40.573
Wash up and have breakfast.

00:28:54.379 --> 00:29:00.301
AMATEUR KISHO MATCH, FINALS

00:29:12.230 --> 00:29:14.858
ROOK

00:29:18.778 --> 00:29:19.863
I resign.

00:30:11.623 --> 00:30:15.585
ASUKA KUNIMI

00:30:36.856 --> 00:30:39.359
I'll become a kishi
and beat Shoichi Yuuki.

00:30:39.442 --> 00:30:41.027
Women can only go so far.

00:30:41.110 --> 00:30:42.445
Me, becoming a kishi?

00:30:42.528 --> 00:30:44.072
There's no way!

00:30:44.155 --> 00:30:45.907
Her strength is real.

00:30:45.990 --> 00:30:49.077
We never know if we will win or lose.

00:30:49.160 --> 00:30:50.995
-Are you mocking me?
-I'm not.

00:30:51.079 --> 00:30:51.871
I'll kill him with shogi.

00:30:51.955 --> 00:30:53.790
I knew it. You're crazy in the head.

00:30:53.873 --> 00:30:55.041
This is getting interesting!

00:30:55.124 --> 00:30:57.210
Straight-up fist fight. It's her thing.

00:30:57.293 --> 00:30:59.087
I'll destroy you tomorrow.

00:31:00.088 --> 00:31:01.798
I look forward to it.

00:31:01.881 --> 00:31:02.757
