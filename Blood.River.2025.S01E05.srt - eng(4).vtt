00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:33.980

[Available on fanqienovel.com & bkneng.com]

[Episode 5]

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:49.020
Sir,

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:50.540
are you ready?

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:53.410
Yes.

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:55.540
Please start.

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:03.820
It's already this bad.

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:27.010
Mu Bai.

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:28.500
Did you kill Chou the Ox?

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:29.450
I did.

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:30.770
What of it?

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:31.940
Then today,

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:33.260
we'll avenge him!

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:40.910
Split up!

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:54.220
Xie Huxiao of the Xie family,

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:56.570
your edge isn't what it was.

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:58.980
He inherits the Dragonfang Saber.

00:02:59.400 --> 00:02:59.940
Huxiao,

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:02.690
looks like the Xies have produced

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:04.010
a killer sharper than us.

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:05.410
You're Buxie?

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:06.940
You've grown this much?

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:08.350
Back then, the very first

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:10.130
to teach me the blade was you.

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:12.220
I've waited for this fight

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:13.540
a long time.

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:14.940
That little blade fanatic

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:17.130
has become a true blade fanatic.

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:39.340
No idea where Su Muyu is.

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:41.890
Don't keep thinking

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:42.850
about your dream boy.

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:44.570
We're here on business.

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:49.450
The Mu family's fake diviner is here?

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:50.660
Fine.

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:52.940
Then let me do a quick reading.

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:53.890
How will

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:55.130
this fight end?

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:01.540
Ah, the blossom side's up,

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:03.130
a sign of good luck!

00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:05.380
Fraud.

00:04:05.710 --> 00:04:06.380
Get over yourself!

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:28.220
Senior.

00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:32.220
Do you think

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:34.700
they can break in?

00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:37.050
They must have made

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:38.220
very thorough preparations.

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:40.100
And among us...

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:42.220
they have an insider.

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:46.580
I haven't contacted

00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:48.250
Blood River headquarters

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:50.030
for many years

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:51.140
to this day.

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:54.850
Perhaps I already

00:04:56.120 --> 00:04:57.460
switched to the enemy's side?

00:04:58.310 --> 00:04:59.050
I believe you, Senior.

00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:03.810
I thought

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:06.140
you had long put me

00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:08.780
on the kill list.

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:11.610
Backed into a corner,

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:14.100
sometimes we're powerless.

00:05:15.070 --> 00:05:15.700
All we can do

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:17.140
is trust each other.

00:05:18.630 --> 00:05:20.370
I trust you the most.

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:22.290
Even if I betray the Spider Shadow Sect,

00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:24.490
I believe you'll still stand

00:05:24.510 --> 00:05:25.810
by the Patriarch.

00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:33.540
What a...

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:37.170
moving speech.

00:05:42.070 --> 00:05:43.100
So moving

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:47.170
that I should die for it.

00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:09.020
It's the spear array!

00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:37.610
Qingyang,

00:06:37.830 --> 00:06:38.490
hold them off a while.

00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:39.370
I'll go find Muyu.

00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:41.220
You're so faithless!

00:06:53.270 --> 00:06:53.980
What are you waiting for?

00:06:54.600 --> 00:06:55.460
Kill them now.

00:06:56.360 --> 00:06:57.170
This isn't a spar.

00:06:57.800 --> 00:06:59.250
It's life and death.

00:06:59.750 --> 00:07:00.900
I'm not here to kill.

00:07:01.390 --> 00:07:02.410
And I told you

00:07:02.950 --> 00:07:03.540
I'm here

00:07:04.360 --> 00:07:05.810
only to find Su Muyu.

00:07:06.870 --> 00:07:07.540
Besides,

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:09.250
they're from Xie family too.

00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:11.100
We all knew each other.

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:13.700
The day they joined the Spider Shadow Sect,

00:07:14.270 --> 00:07:14.930
they were

00:07:15.480 --> 00:07:17.220
no longer of the Xie family.

00:07:22.480 --> 00:07:23.410
To join the Spider Shadow Sect

00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:25.930
is every Blood River warrior's honor.

00:07:26.680 --> 00:07:27.370
And they

00:07:28.040 --> 00:07:29.050
should have been

00:07:29.630 --> 00:07:31.460
your Xie family's pride!

00:07:33.160 --> 00:07:34.610
Should I call you Mr. Luo

00:07:35.430 --> 00:07:36.340
or Mr. Ke?

00:07:36.630 --> 00:07:38.170
My master mentioned you.

00:07:38.480 --> 00:07:39.490
I've heard a lot.

00:07:40.070 --> 00:07:41.170
Go find Su Muyu.

00:07:41.630 --> 00:07:42.780
I'll hold him off.

00:07:57.240 --> 00:07:57.810
The array's core is here!

00:08:07.560 --> 00:08:08.050
All right.

00:08:09.120 --> 00:08:09.930
We can move on now.

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:12.100
No one is leaving!

00:08:35.320 --> 00:08:37.010
Soul-Swap Technique.

00:09:00.320 --> 00:09:01.700
So the Patriarch's inner world looks like this.

00:09:02.750 --> 00:09:04.940
It's literal hell.

00:09:26.750 --> 00:09:27.890
What bug is that?

00:09:29.120 --> 00:09:30.580
It disturbed me.

00:09:34.200 --> 00:09:35.220
That's the old master's

00:09:35.240 --> 00:09:37.130
messenger dagger.

00:09:38.670 --> 00:09:39.340
Changhe,

00:09:40.030 --> 00:09:41.300
he's urging you...

00:09:41.480 --> 00:09:42.010
Nope.

00:09:44.030 --> 00:09:45.130
Let me nap.

00:09:50.390 --> 00:09:51.530
You little brat,

00:09:52.240 --> 00:09:53.420
you're laying a board, huh?

00:09:58.510 --> 00:10:00.100
You're the sharp one, Uncle Zhe.

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:02.580
They're all inside my setup,

00:10:03.390 --> 00:10:04.770
just waiting for me to...

00:10:05.670 --> 00:10:06.730
reap the reward.

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:20.580
Su Muyu!

00:10:21.360 --> 00:10:22.180
I haven't met you.

00:10:23.030 --> 00:10:23.700
Looks like the Xie family

00:10:23.720 --> 00:10:25.130
hid a fine killer.

00:10:25.440 --> 00:10:26.580
I often asked my master

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:28.100
how my blade work was.

00:10:28.670 --> 00:10:29.370
He always said

00:10:30.270 --> 00:10:30.980
my blade skills

00:10:31.360 --> 00:10:32.420
are already first

00:10:32.630 --> 00:10:33.530
among this generation.

00:10:34.630 --> 00:10:35.180
But compared

00:10:35.200 --> 00:10:36.730
with the sword-first Su Muyu,

00:10:37.150 --> 00:10:38.460
there's still a long gap.

00:10:39.550 --> 00:10:40.300
Who is your master?

00:10:41.630 --> 00:10:42.180
Xie Qidao

00:10:42.750 --> 00:10:43.420
from the Xie family.

00:10:44.240 --> 00:10:44.940
Uncle Qidao

00:10:44.960 --> 00:10:46.060
is a fine teacher.

00:10:46.510 --> 00:10:47.650
You're his disciple...

00:10:48.120 --> 00:10:49.420
No wonder you got this far.

00:10:51.080 --> 00:10:52.460
Keep your compliments.

00:10:53.480 --> 00:10:54.850
The best praise for me

00:10:55.320 --> 00:10:56.490
is a fight!

00:10:59.790 --> 00:11:00.370
Su Muyu,

00:11:00.840 --> 00:11:01.530
stand down here.

00:11:01.790 --> 00:11:02.300
Xuewei,

00:11:03.390 --> 00:11:03.940
you're here.

00:11:04.240 --> 00:11:04.770
Do not interrupt

00:11:04.790 --> 00:11:05.730
our duel.

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:06.850
If you interfere,

00:11:07.550 --> 00:11:08.580
I'll kill you!

00:11:09.270 --> 00:11:10.220
You're threatening me?

00:11:10.960 --> 00:11:11.770
Just a warning.

00:11:12.320 --> 00:11:13.420
As you wish!

00:11:15.240 --> 00:11:16.300
I'm here to fight with your sword,

00:11:16.750 --> 00:11:17.820
not a shabby umbrella!

00:11:18.720 --> 00:11:20.060
The umbrella is my sword.

00:11:20.240 --> 00:11:21.220
You know what I expect.

00:11:21.720 --> 00:11:22.100
Do I

00:11:22.510 --> 00:11:23.300
lack the standing

00:11:23.360 --> 00:11:24.770
to see your Eighteen-Sword Array?

00:11:25.600 --> 00:11:26.530
Use your blade

00:11:27.840 --> 00:11:28.850
to witness my sword.

00:11:34.910 --> 00:11:35.460
Fine!

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:41.770
Still-Arms Technique...

00:11:42.510 --> 00:11:43.700
The Xie family's secret art,

00:11:43.790 --> 00:11:44.490
near-invincible.

00:11:46.440 --> 00:11:47.060
Su Muyu, careful!

00:12:35.630 --> 00:12:36.420
Reveal your real skills,

00:12:36.870 --> 00:12:38.060
or you'll die under my blade!

00:12:38.390 --> 00:12:39.980
Your blade work is superb.

00:12:41.030 --> 00:12:42.490
No wonder Uncle Qidao called you

00:12:42.550 --> 00:12:43.890
this era's top bladesman.

00:12:45.550 --> 00:12:46.250
But his other line

00:12:46.270 --> 00:12:47.340
is also true.

00:12:48.510 --> 00:12:49.010
What?

00:12:49.510 --> 00:12:50.940
The gap between us

00:12:52.030 --> 00:12:53.300
is a chasm.

00:12:54.720 --> 00:12:55.890
Eighteen-Sword Array, activate!

00:13:25.120 --> 00:13:26.300
So this is the Eighteen-Sword Array.

00:13:29.600 --> 00:13:30.460
One person alone

00:13:30.910 --> 00:13:32.300
can command so many blades.

00:14:02.480 --> 00:14:03.180
This old man

00:14:03.840 --> 00:14:05.530
who sometimes looks kindly and gentle...

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:07.490
what past does he really carry?

00:14:12.360 --> 00:14:12.980
Who's there?

00:14:17.390 --> 00:14:18.300
Tonight...

00:14:19.630 --> 00:14:21.370
If we both die here,

00:14:22.910 --> 00:14:23.650
are you afraid?

00:14:24.600 --> 00:14:25.700
Die here...

00:14:26.200 --> 00:14:27.850
Don't talk about death.

00:14:28.360 --> 00:14:28.940
Sir,

00:14:29.390 --> 00:14:30.650
let me finish this drag.

00:14:32.030 --> 00:14:33.730
Then I'll go out and wipe them out!

00:14:36.790 --> 00:14:37.340
Su Zhe,

00:14:38.600 --> 00:14:39.180
I give you my word.

00:14:39.870 --> 00:14:40.650
If this time

00:14:40.870 --> 00:14:42.130
we make it out alive,

00:14:42.630 --> 00:14:44.700
I'll allow you to leave Blood River for a while

00:14:46.480 --> 00:14:48.100
to see your wife and daughter.

00:14:48.510 --> 00:14:49.610
Only for a while?

00:14:52.080 --> 00:14:53.010
Wife...

00:14:54.790 --> 00:14:55.460
And daughter...

00:15:13.720 --> 00:15:14.300
Sir...

00:15:15.390 --> 00:15:16.530
After today,

00:15:17.440 --> 00:15:18.650
consider this term's Kui

00:15:18.750 --> 00:15:19.530
already dead.

00:15:21.200 --> 00:15:22.100
Kui?

00:15:24.550 --> 00:15:25.980
I hate this role.

00:15:27.120 --> 00:15:28.460
I'm leaving Blood River.

00:15:32.480 --> 00:15:34.010
I want to be with my wife

00:15:35.120 --> 00:15:36.250
and daughter for life,

00:15:37.790 --> 00:15:40.610
live together, happy.

00:15:51.840 --> 00:15:52.650
My dear...

00:16:32.910 --> 00:16:34.100
I poisoned him,

00:16:35.790 --> 00:16:36.820
and left a mark.

00:16:38.720 --> 00:16:40.100
Even if he cures it,

00:16:40.870 --> 00:16:41.730
he will forever

00:16:41.790 --> 00:16:43.180
carry that mark.

00:16:44.750 --> 00:16:46.490
Even if he flees to the ends of the earth,

00:16:48.030 --> 00:16:48.980
even if his whole life

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:50.130
he never dares face me,

00:16:52.960 --> 00:16:54.610
he still won't forget me.

00:16:57.480 --> 00:16:58.420
So it's you.

00:16:59.790 --> 00:17:00.490
So...

00:17:02.150 --> 00:17:03.770
I'd already met you.

00:17:18.880 --> 00:17:19.660
Who are you?

00:17:29.310 --> 00:17:29.860
I...

00:17:33.480 --> 00:17:34.570
You can see me?

00:17:37.240 --> 00:17:38.010
Has the Patriarch's

00:17:38.590 --> 00:17:40.010
self-awareness in this illusion

00:17:40.310 --> 00:17:41.090
awakened?

00:17:42.920 --> 00:17:43.490
Oh no!

00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:47.600
Who...

00:17:49.160 --> 00:17:49.860
exactly are you?

00:17:50.240 --> 00:17:50.660
This...

00:17:51.720 --> 00:17:52.620
this is a dream.

00:17:53.640 --> 00:17:54.330
A dream?

00:17:54.920 --> 00:17:55.530
Yes!

00:17:56.400 --> 00:17:56.770
I...

00:17:57.110 --> 00:17:58.530
I am only a figure

00:17:58.720 --> 00:17:59.570
passing through your dream.

00:18:02.400 --> 00:18:02.860
Right.

00:18:04.030 --> 00:18:04.810
That's it.

00:18:06.200 --> 00:18:07.090
Back away slowly.

00:18:07.960 --> 00:18:09.570
Just slip out of his sight.

00:18:10.960 --> 00:18:11.730
Who sent you?

00:18:17.480 --> 00:18:18.330
Phantom Step.

00:18:19.030 --> 00:18:20.180
You're of the Su family.

00:18:20.790 --> 00:18:23.140
But the Su family dared betray me!

00:18:28.070 --> 00:18:28.660
Too bad.

00:18:29.440 --> 00:18:30.900
If I'm killed in this illusion,

00:18:31.160 --> 00:18:32.700
will the real me die?

00:18:33.590 --> 00:18:35.010
Master never taught me this.

00:18:35.920 --> 00:18:36.380
No.

00:18:37.030 --> 00:18:38.730
The Su family betrayed me long ago.

00:18:41.440 --> 00:18:42.380
Only Su Muyu

00:18:42.480 --> 00:18:43.490
still stands with me.

00:18:46.310 --> 00:18:46.980
Why am I

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:48.460
still so surprised?

00:18:52.960 --> 00:18:53.570
Could it be

00:18:54.270 --> 00:18:55.570
his present memories

00:18:56.440 --> 00:18:57.900
are affecting

00:18:58.270 --> 00:18:59.760
his former self in here?

00:19:00.550 --> 00:19:01.660
Who are you really?

00:19:03.070 --> 00:19:03.570
I...

00:19:04.550 --> 00:19:05.570
I'm Bai Hehuai.

00:19:05.880 --> 00:19:07.250
the miracle physician treating you.

00:19:08.110 --> 00:19:08.700
I came

00:19:09.110 --> 00:19:09.940
to search

00:19:10.350 --> 00:19:11.620
for a way to cure you!

00:19:13.480 --> 00:19:14.900
But you use Su family arts.

00:19:15.480 --> 00:19:16.460
You're lying to me!

00:19:27.160 --> 00:19:27.940
So it turns out

00:19:28.680 --> 00:19:30.010
being killed in the illusion

00:19:30.440 --> 00:19:31.900
just gets you thrown out.

00:20:04.880 --> 00:20:06.180
I'll ask again

00:20:06.830 --> 00:20:08.220
the question from before.

00:20:12.550 --> 00:20:13.140
Who...

00:20:14.240 --> 00:20:15.250
are you really?

00:20:20.790 --> 00:20:21.900
The Eighteen-Sword Array is up.

00:20:22.400 --> 00:20:23.770
Can you break through my array?

00:20:24.240 --> 00:20:25.730
I don't see a way to crack it.

00:20:26.590 --> 00:20:27.180
But...

00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:29.330
only obstacles you can't cross

00:20:30.070 --> 00:20:31.010
make crossing meaningful,

00:20:31.070 --> 00:20:31.570
right?

00:20:32.510 --> 00:20:33.980
Only winning a doomed game

00:20:34.720 --> 00:20:35.700
gives winning meaning.

00:20:36.400 --> 00:20:37.290
You're a blade fanatic.

00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:38.700
Maybe.

00:20:39.310 --> 00:20:40.460
Master says so too.

00:20:41.070 --> 00:20:41.810
What about you, Lord Kui?

00:20:42.440 --> 00:20:43.250
Are you a sword fanatic?

00:20:44.070 --> 00:20:45.250
A sword is just a weapon.

00:20:46.240 --> 00:20:47.660
Cling too hard to the sword itself

00:20:48.240 --> 00:20:49.770
and you become its slave.

00:20:50.350 --> 00:20:51.220
Did a Blood River master

00:20:51.240 --> 00:20:51.980
tell you that?

00:20:52.550 --> 00:20:52.980
No.

00:20:53.640 --> 00:20:54.180
These words

00:20:55.400 --> 00:20:57.420
were carved on No-Sword City's wall.

00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:06.980
You've practiced from dawn to dusk.

00:21:07.830 --> 00:21:09.290
You're really

00:21:09.310 --> 00:21:10.660
[Zhuo Yuluo from No-Sword City]
a persistent kid.

00:21:11.200 --> 00:21:11.980
Because I want to become

00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:13.250
as skilled as you, Father.

00:21:14.240 --> 00:21:14.810
Oh, Father,

00:21:15.240 --> 00:21:17.010
Third Uncle lives for the sword.

00:21:17.440 --> 00:21:18.220
So why

00:21:18.400 --> 00:21:19.570
you've long reached the Heaven level

00:21:19.880 --> 00:21:20.490
while he's still stuck

00:21:20.510 --> 00:21:21.490
at the Earth level?

00:21:22.110 --> 00:21:22.700
Because

00:21:23.350 --> 00:21:24.860
his heart holds nothing but practice.

00:21:25.240 --> 00:21:25.700
That's why

00:21:25.920 --> 00:21:26.730
he can't move forward.

00:21:27.920 --> 00:21:28.730
I don't get it.

00:21:29.240 --> 00:21:30.380
Father, what do you have in your heart

00:21:30.400 --> 00:21:31.380
that he doesn't?

00:21:31.830 --> 00:21:32.570
Silly child,

00:21:33.160 --> 00:21:34.700
I have you in mine.

00:21:37.830 --> 00:21:39.570
Your devotion to the blade is pure,

00:21:40.640 --> 00:21:41.770
but why must you beat me?

00:21:43.240 --> 00:21:44.810
Just to be stronger than I?

00:21:46.720 --> 00:21:48.330
If all you see is strong vs. weak,

00:21:51.310 --> 00:21:52.180
then your blade

00:21:55.310 --> 00:21:56.810
will never be the strongest.

00:21:59.440 --> 00:22:00.050
Win or lose,

00:22:00.350 --> 00:22:01.700
that's what gives meaning to me!

00:22:25.160 --> 00:22:25.700
This strike...

00:22:26.550 --> 00:22:27.460
It deserves respect.

00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:45.620
Does Eighteen-Sword Array mean

00:22:45.680 --> 00:22:46.620
only eighteen swords?

00:22:47.480 --> 00:22:49.330
Why not one hundred eighty,

00:22:49.880 --> 00:22:51.140
one thousand eight hundred?

00:23:04.680 --> 00:23:05.980
Or eighteen thousand?

00:23:28.750 --> 00:23:29.490
What was

00:23:29.920 --> 00:23:30.420
that last strike called?

00:23:31.200 --> 00:23:32.250
Flying blades scattered,

00:23:32.590 --> 00:23:33.490
like evening rain.

00:23:33.880 --> 00:23:35.010
Long sword strikes,

00:23:35.880 --> 00:23:36.730
like unstoppable rainbow.

00:23:37.200 --> 00:23:38.570
That strike takes my name,

00:23:38.920 --> 00:23:39.620
Muyu.

00:23:40.310 --> 00:23:41.220
You name it after yourself?

00:23:43.400 --> 00:23:44.770
Someday I'll forge a technique

00:23:45.350 --> 00:23:46.090
named after myself, Buxie.

00:23:47.680 --> 00:23:48.730
You're devoted to the blade,

00:23:49.240 --> 00:23:50.090
obsessed with it.

00:23:50.750 --> 00:23:51.700
Everything you fight for

00:23:51.750 --> 00:23:52.620
is for the blade.

00:23:53.440 --> 00:23:54.490
But a blade is dead steel.

00:23:56.070 --> 00:23:57.050
You need to find

00:23:58.030 --> 00:23:59.660
the cause and the reason

00:23:59.720 --> 00:24:00.620
that's truly worth dying for.

00:24:01.200 --> 00:24:01.810
A reason?

00:24:04.200 --> 00:24:04.860
I don't get it.

00:24:05.590 --> 00:24:06.940
Like how I must defeat you,

00:24:08.310 --> 00:24:09.250
because I can't lose.

00:24:10.030 --> 00:24:11.050
I still don't get you.

00:24:12.510 --> 00:24:13.660
But to beat you,

00:24:14.310 --> 00:24:15.250
I'll try to find it.

00:24:19.200 --> 00:24:19.980
You're leaving?

00:24:20.550 --> 00:24:21.290
I said earlier

00:24:21.830 --> 00:24:22.460
I didn't come here

00:24:23.070 --> 00:24:24.090
to kill anyone.

00:24:34.790 --> 00:24:35.330
Xuewei,

00:24:36.160 --> 00:24:37.660
don't tell me you want a fight too?

00:24:38.070 --> 00:24:38.900
Fight my foot.

00:24:41.680 --> 00:24:42.290
You're bleeding.

00:24:44.070 --> 00:24:44.810
Treat it now.

00:24:47.400 --> 00:24:48.620
I don't dare use your meds.

00:24:50.270 --> 00:24:51.810
I've got a young miracle physician with me now.

00:24:52.480 --> 00:24:53.220
I won't dare use

00:24:53.240 --> 00:24:54.620
your medicine that can kill a cow.

00:24:55.480 --> 00:24:56.730
Your young miracle physician?

00:24:57.590 --> 00:24:58.980
You sure she's still alive?

00:25:02.440 --> 00:25:03.220
If you want to save her,

00:25:03.550 --> 00:25:04.730
break my poison array first.

00:25:05.590 --> 00:25:06.050
Xuewei,

00:25:06.750 --> 00:25:07.460
you know clearly

00:25:07.510 --> 00:25:08.460
this array won't hold me long.

00:25:10.790 --> 00:25:11.330
Sir,

00:25:12.440 --> 00:25:13.050
trust me.

00:25:13.790 --> 00:25:14.730
I mean no harm.

00:25:15.640 --> 00:25:17.380
You wield Su family arts.

00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:19.460
You use this Soul-Swap Technique

00:25:19.590 --> 00:25:20.380
not to detox me

00:25:20.400 --> 00:25:21.570
at all,

00:25:22.160 --> 00:25:23.220
but to pry

00:25:23.310 --> 00:25:25.420
into my mind's secrets!

00:25:27.270 --> 00:25:28.420
Trying to learn

00:25:28.440 --> 00:25:30.140
Blood River's secrets?

00:25:30.250 --> 00:25:31.530
Did those fools

00:25:31.590 --> 00:25:32.980
from the Three Families ever tell you?

00:25:33.480 --> 00:25:34.330
Some secrets

00:25:34.720 --> 00:25:36.220
kill faster

00:25:36.370 --> 00:25:38.340
the more you know!

00:25:48.160 --> 00:25:48.810
Sir...

00:25:55.490 --> 00:25:56.270
Die!

00:26:14.790 --> 00:26:16.090
Mu Xuewei

00:26:17.960 --> 00:26:19.420
of the Mu family?

00:26:26.440 --> 00:26:27.940
Su family's Three-Needle Threading.

00:26:28.310 --> 00:26:28.900
Who are you really?

00:26:28.920 --> 00:26:29.620
Don't even know who I am,

00:26:29.790 --> 00:26:30.660
and you struck that hard!

00:26:34.510 --> 00:26:34.980
Trap.

00:26:39.750 --> 00:26:40.180
Oh no.

00:26:40.550 --> 00:26:41.530
They've breached the rear courtyard.

00:26:50.920 --> 00:26:51.570
Su Muyu, you liar!

00:26:51.750 --> 00:26:52.460
You promised with you here,

00:26:52.680 --> 00:26:53.570
I'd be safe and sound!

00:26:58.960 --> 00:26:59.460
Physician!

00:27:06.480 --> 00:27:06.980
Su Muyu!

00:27:07.240 --> 00:27:07.980
Why are you going down there?

00:27:08.160 --> 00:27:09.220
I just found him.

00:27:09.240 --> 00:27:10.050
I don't want to die yet!

00:27:10.070 --> 00:27:10.700
Physician, don't panic!

00:27:24.070 --> 00:27:24.940
You really came.

00:27:25.680 --> 00:27:26.530
I promised you.

00:27:27.310 --> 00:27:27.810
With me here,

00:27:28.720 --> 00:27:29.330
you'll be safe.

00:27:55.070 --> 00:27:56.090
That's high.

00:27:56.550 --> 00:27:57.730
How do we get across?

00:28:09.270 --> 00:28:10.460
That stone gate weighs a ton.

00:28:11.350 --> 00:28:12.250
My palm force won't budge it.

00:28:39.920 --> 00:28:40.570
Xuewei

00:28:41.110 --> 00:28:41.900
pays respects to you, Sir.

00:28:50.200 --> 00:28:50.980
Sleep smoke...

00:28:54.110 --> 00:28:54.620
Let's move.

00:29:11.240 --> 00:29:11.660
Don't rush.

00:29:16.030 --> 00:29:16.570
Oh no!

00:29:17.160 --> 00:29:17.860
I'm doomed!

00:29:18.070 --> 00:29:18.940
I forgot it.

00:29:19.270 --> 00:29:19.980
What now?

00:29:20.070 --> 00:29:21.420
I'm really going to die of poison.

00:29:22.830 --> 00:29:23.420
Antidote!

00:29:24.680 --> 00:29:25.290
Hurry!

00:29:25.310 --> 00:29:26.450
Or I'll actually die soon.

00:29:33.640 --> 00:29:34.290
You're losing outside?

00:29:36.590 --> 00:29:37.530
Twelve Zodiacs of Spider Shadow

00:29:37.830 --> 00:29:39.220
aren't that easy to handle.

00:29:39.920 --> 00:29:40.570
At most,

00:29:40.920 --> 00:29:42.140
we can hold for a while.

00:29:43.440 --> 00:29:44.770
Where's that kid from Xie family?

00:29:45.920 --> 00:29:46.490
He left.

00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:47.810
Left?

00:29:49.070 --> 00:29:49.770
What about Su Muyu?

00:29:51.640 --> 00:29:52.570
He jumped into that pit

00:29:53.590 --> 00:29:55.250
with the miracle physician from Medicine King Valley.

00:30:01.400 --> 00:30:01.900
Perfect.

00:30:02.480 --> 00:30:03.220
Toss poison down there,

00:30:03.440 --> 00:30:04.320
the deadliest kind.

00:30:04.920 --> 00:30:05.460
Are you insane?

00:30:05.830 --> 00:30:06.730
Su Muyu is still inside!

00:30:09.160 --> 00:30:10.530
You gave him an antidote,

00:30:10.880 --> 00:30:12.180
sealed in his sword hilt.

00:30:12.550 --> 00:30:13.770
You think I don't know about it?

00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:15.700
Poison them.

00:30:16.070 --> 00:30:17.380
We can't miss this chance!

00:30:18.440 --> 00:30:19.250
Su Muyu doesn't have to die,

00:30:19.960 --> 00:30:21.490
but that physician must die today!

00:30:22.310 --> 00:30:24.010
Hurry!

00:30:36.200 --> 00:30:36.660
Careful.

00:30:37.030 --> 00:30:37.730
Why?

00:30:37.960 --> 00:30:38.460
It's poison.

00:30:43.510 --> 00:30:44.010
Take it.

00:30:45.160 --> 00:30:46.010
I know it's poison.

00:30:46.480 --> 00:30:47.220
I mean,

00:30:47.310 --> 00:30:48.050
why should I be careful?

00:30:48.680 --> 00:30:49.490
I'm from Medicine King Valley,

00:30:49.510 --> 00:30:50.730
the Valley Lord's junior,

00:30:50.920 --> 00:30:52.250
and the Wen family head's granddaughter.

00:30:52.590 --> 00:30:53.380
You think I'm scared of poison?

00:31:17.400 --> 00:31:18.010
Classic you,

00:31:18.070 --> 00:31:19.090
really are full of surprises.

00:31:20.790 --> 00:31:21.380
But...

00:31:21.960 --> 00:31:22.730
what poison art

00:31:23.110 --> 00:31:24.660
did that lady train?

00:31:24.880 --> 00:31:25.530
She makes herself

00:31:25.550 --> 00:31:26.620
out-and-out poisonous.

00:31:27.790 --> 00:31:28.700
When Xuewei was little,

00:31:28.720 --> 00:31:29.660
she learned the Poison-Sand Palm.

00:31:30.350 --> 00:31:30.980
Sharp eye, physician.

00:31:31.590 --> 00:31:32.810
You spotted it at once.

00:31:33.480 --> 00:31:34.290
Once we're out,

00:31:34.790 --> 00:31:35.530
I'll fill you in

00:31:36.200 --> 00:31:37.180
on the details.

00:31:37.480 --> 00:31:38.460
For now, the priority

00:31:38.790 --> 00:31:40.050
is getting back to the Patriarch.

00:31:41.440 --> 00:31:42.770
Although I've destroyed the blade

00:31:43.310 --> 00:31:44.330
that breached Spider's Nest,

00:31:45.070 --> 00:31:46.530
Changhe hasn't even moved yet.

00:31:48.240 --> 00:31:50.050
The Wen family has plenty

00:31:50.270 --> 00:31:50.900
who practice poison arts,

00:31:51.720 --> 00:31:52.490
but more often than not,

00:31:52.680 --> 00:31:53.730
they poison themselves

00:31:54.200 --> 00:31:55.490
before they kill others.

00:31:56.640 --> 00:31:57.860
Still, that Poison-Sand Palm

00:31:58.160 --> 00:31:58.770
isn't exactly

00:31:58.790 --> 00:32:00.010
some complex art.

00:32:00.880 --> 00:32:02.050
She must've slipped in training.

00:32:02.240 --> 00:32:03.530
Some mishap, who knows,

00:32:03.920 --> 00:32:05.490
that spread venom through her body.

00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:07.940
By rights,

00:32:08.200 --> 00:32:09.180
she shouldn't have survived.

00:32:10.070 --> 00:32:11.330
She must've been saved

00:32:11.400 --> 00:32:13.220
by something miraculous.

00:32:15.920 --> 00:32:16.940
Looks like I guessed right.

00:32:17.720 --> 00:32:18.180
Even so,

00:32:18.480 --> 00:32:19.620
though she lived,

00:32:19.960 --> 00:32:20.810
the poison remains.

00:32:22.070 --> 00:32:24.420
If someone carelessly brushes

00:32:25.310 --> 00:32:26.660
against her,

00:32:27.400 --> 00:32:28.570
they'll die miserably

00:32:29.160 --> 00:32:30.700
in a short time.

00:32:34.920 --> 00:32:35.460
Can you cure her?

00:32:36.270 --> 00:32:37.980
She tried to kill me on sight!

00:32:38.310 --> 00:32:39.570
Even after I dove into this secret passage,

00:32:39.790 --> 00:32:40.810
she sent a poisonous blossom

00:32:40.830 --> 00:32:41.570
chasing after me.

00:32:42.110 --> 00:32:43.530
And you want her saved now?

00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:44.530
That doesn't track.

00:32:46.110 --> 00:32:46.570
Sorry.

00:32:47.590 --> 00:32:49.460
She's steeped in venom,

00:32:50.200 --> 00:32:51.050
but she's gentle,

00:32:51.720 --> 00:32:53.140
keeps her distance from people

00:32:53.680 --> 00:32:54.980
for fear of harming them.

00:32:55.720 --> 00:32:56.900
If she struck at you,

00:32:57.590 --> 00:32:58.050
it was likely

00:32:58.070 --> 00:32:59.050
under family orders.

00:33:01.140 --> 00:33:02.480
Su Muyu,

00:33:02.550 --> 00:33:04.190
I'm honestly curious

00:33:04.400 --> 00:33:05.140
what kind of

00:33:05.200 --> 00:33:06.420
softhearted idealist you are.

00:33:06.640 --> 00:33:08.220
She truly meant to kill me.

00:33:08.220 --> 00:33:09.300
I could feel it.

00:33:10.550 --> 00:33:12.010
As for why...

00:33:13.030 --> 00:33:14.090
no idea.

00:33:19.270 --> 00:33:19.660
Fine.

00:33:20.920 --> 00:33:22.420
If after this,

00:33:22.720 --> 00:33:23.290
she and I

00:33:23.790 --> 00:33:24.570
are both alive

00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:25.860
and no longer enemies,

00:33:26.680 --> 00:33:27.380
I can cure her.

00:33:28.350 --> 00:33:28.940
One condition,

00:33:29.350 --> 00:33:29.940
simple...

00:33:31.480 --> 00:33:32.330
We'll pay enough.

00:33:33.030 --> 00:33:34.010
No wonder you're Blood River's Kui!

00:33:34.400 --> 00:33:35.570
You catch on fast.

00:33:37.400 --> 00:33:39.380
Then, Lord Kui,

00:33:39.960 --> 00:33:41.290
how do we get out?

00:33:44.830 --> 00:33:46.090
While we spoke,

00:33:46.750 --> 00:33:47.420
I thought it through.

00:33:48.110 --> 00:33:49.420
The mechanism should be at these two spots.

00:34:14.370 --> 00:34:15.740
Let's move.

00:34:17.840 --> 00:34:18.980
It looks kinda scary.

00:34:20.110 --> 00:34:21.260
No traps, right?

00:34:22.630 --> 00:34:23.130
No.

00:34:23.840 --> 00:34:24.740
This is the escape route.

00:34:25.510 --> 00:34:26.170
No more

00:34:26.190 --> 00:34:27.010
tricks ahead.

00:34:36.700 --> 00:34:40.820
[Luojiuxiao Inn]

00:35:02.580 --> 00:35:04.460
[Shore]

00:35:08.550 --> 00:35:09.130
Uncle Zhe,

00:35:09.960 --> 00:35:10.980
time to work!

00:35:19.880 --> 00:35:20.690
Bad luck.

00:35:22.230 --> 00:35:22.940
Easy, master.

00:35:23.800 --> 00:35:24.740
What's there to fear?

00:35:27.110 --> 00:35:29.010
I just can't stand that crow,

00:35:29.030 --> 00:35:30.340
so I cursed it.

00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:32.090
Sons of the Su family

00:35:32.800 --> 00:35:34.300
can't be timid.

00:35:35.150 --> 00:35:35.610
Yes.

00:35:39.230 --> 00:35:39.650
Sir.

00:35:41.360 --> 00:35:42.260
Any news?

00:35:42.630 --> 00:35:43.650
Xie and Mu joined up

00:35:44.110 --> 00:35:45.340
and stormed Spider's Nest.

00:35:45.800 --> 00:35:46.360
So far

00:35:46.360 --> 00:35:47.610
they haven't taken the Dormant Dragon Sword.

00:35:48.030 --> 00:35:49.380
But the Nest's defenses

00:35:49.550 --> 00:35:50.780
are breached.

00:35:55.670 --> 00:35:57.210
Those two old foxes

00:35:58.280 --> 00:36:00.010
actually teamed up.

00:36:01.760 --> 00:36:02.780
What about Su Changhe?

00:36:03.710 --> 00:36:05.010
I wanted him to move at once.

00:36:05.030 --> 00:36:06.530
Did the messenger dagger reach him?

00:36:07.510 --> 00:36:08.130
He rejected it.

00:36:09.070 --> 00:36:10.090
He rejected?

00:36:10.280 --> 00:36:10.860
Sir,

00:36:11.360 --> 00:36:12.300
Su Changhe

00:36:12.590 --> 00:36:14.050
just won't fight Su Muyu.

00:36:14.550 --> 00:36:15.090
If you ask me,

00:36:15.590 --> 00:36:16.650
give me command.

00:36:17.280 --> 00:36:18.530
I'll lead a strike now

00:36:19.150 --> 00:36:20.820
and seize the Dormant Dragon Sword!

00:36:21.480 --> 00:36:22.460
Only Su Changhe

00:36:22.480 --> 00:36:23.380
can handle Su Muyu.

00:36:24.070 --> 00:36:25.380
And only if our Su family

00:36:25.800 --> 00:36:26.610
wins the Dormant Dragon Sword,

00:36:26.960 --> 00:36:28.690
and holds both Su Muyu

00:36:28.920 --> 00:36:30.260
and Su Changhe,

00:36:30.670 --> 00:36:31.780
will Xie and Mu

00:36:32.550 --> 00:36:34.260
be kept in check.

00:36:36.590 --> 00:36:37.900
You mean...

00:36:39.150 --> 00:36:39.530
Sir,

00:36:39.960 --> 00:36:41.030
Su Changhe and Uncle Zhe

00:36:41.030 --> 00:36:42.380
have left Luojiuxiao Inn.

00:36:50.880 --> 00:36:53.380
It's moonrise again.

00:37:01.840 --> 00:37:02.940
Did you cure

00:37:03.800 --> 00:37:04.900
the Patriarch's poison?

00:37:06.150 --> 00:37:08.130
It's suppressed for now.

00:37:08.800 --> 00:37:09.860
After performing the Soul-Swap Technique

00:37:09.880 --> 00:37:11.260
on the Patriarch,

00:37:11.760 --> 00:37:13.570
I've got some idea

00:37:14.150 --> 00:37:15.340
how to treat the poison.

00:37:17.400 --> 00:37:18.130
My thanks, physician.

00:37:23.030 --> 00:37:23.530
Lord Kui,

00:37:24.320 --> 00:37:25.210
I suddenly remembered something.

00:37:25.760 --> 00:37:26.300
That day,

00:37:26.440 --> 00:37:27.650
leaving the Medicine Hall,

00:37:28.190 --> 00:37:29.490
I met a man at the gate

00:37:29.510 --> 00:37:30.490
with a staff in hand.

00:37:31.360 --> 00:37:33.210
Was he from your Su family?

00:37:34.550 --> 00:37:35.300
That was Uncle Zhe.

00:37:38.960 --> 00:37:39.820
He was...

00:37:41.590 --> 00:37:42.820
the previous Kui, right?

00:37:47.280 --> 00:37:48.420
Looks like you already found

00:37:48.440 --> 00:37:49.460
the answer yourself.

00:37:50.590 --> 00:37:51.530
Won't you ask me

00:37:51.960 --> 00:37:53.380
why I need to know?

00:37:54.190 --> 00:37:55.050
That's your secret.

00:37:55.960 --> 00:37:56.650
I won't pry.

00:37:57.230 --> 00:37:57.900
Didn't you say

00:37:58.360 --> 00:37:59.300
Blood River's Kui

00:37:59.760 --> 00:38:00.900
guard the Patriarch

00:38:00.920 --> 00:38:01.980
to the death?

00:38:02.840 --> 00:38:03.690
Then why

00:38:04.110 --> 00:38:05.300
could he step down?

00:38:07.110 --> 00:38:07.860
No one knows.

00:38:08.480 --> 00:38:09.320
It's a secret

00:38:09.550 --> 00:38:11.140
between Uncle Zhe and the Patriarch.

00:38:12.030 --> 00:38:12.610
I know!

00:38:15.150 --> 00:38:16.610
In the Patriarch's memories,

00:38:17.000 --> 00:38:17.490
I saw it.

00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:21.260
To protect him,

00:38:21.760 --> 00:38:22.780
Uncle Zhe was badly hurt.

00:38:23.590 --> 00:38:24.420
So the Patriarch

00:38:24.510 --> 00:38:25.380
gave his word:

00:38:25.880 --> 00:38:27.340
if they both survived,

00:38:27.800 --> 00:38:28.490
he'd allow him

00:38:28.840 --> 00:38:29.940
to lay down the title of Kui

00:38:30.440 --> 00:38:31.130
and return him

00:38:32.190 --> 00:38:32.530
his freedom.

00:38:36.190 --> 00:38:37.420
Only somehow,

00:38:38.840 --> 00:38:39.820
even then he didn't leave.

00:38:42.800 --> 00:38:44.090
There's a secret passage in Spider's Nest.

00:38:44.360 --> 00:38:45.300
It's long.

00:38:45.710 --> 00:38:47.300
It runs straight to Sanli Pavilion outside the city.

00:38:47.920 --> 00:38:48.340
Uncle Zhe,

00:38:49.030 --> 00:38:50.380
how about we split up?

00:38:50.670 --> 00:38:51.790
You wait at Sanli Pavilion

00:38:51.840 --> 00:38:52.860
and kill that young miracle physician.

00:38:53.400 --> 00:38:55.130
I'll hit Spider's Nest and take the Dormant Dragon Sword.

00:38:57.920 --> 00:38:59.460
So many experts in the Su family,

00:38:59.920 --> 00:39:01.340
why is it always us running errands?

00:39:01.880 --> 00:39:03.380
You're commanding this time,

00:39:03.630 --> 00:39:05.010
so call more people in.

00:39:05.480 --> 00:39:06.860
I used to be a Nameless.

00:39:07.440 --> 00:39:08.820
When I call the guys

00:39:08.840 --> 00:39:09.530
to show up and help,

00:39:09.800 --> 00:39:10.780
they barely look at me.

00:39:12.800 --> 00:39:13.740
I've gone through fire with you

00:39:13.760 --> 00:39:14.530
so many times,

00:39:15.110 --> 00:39:16.010
I trust you.

00:39:18.590 --> 00:39:19.610
You brat.

00:39:20.150 --> 00:39:21.490
I know you're scheming

00:39:21.510 --> 00:39:22.300
something nasty.

00:39:22.920 --> 00:39:23.670
I won't question you,

00:39:23.710 --> 00:39:24.460
and I won't stop you.

00:39:24.920 --> 00:39:25.530
I'm just

00:39:25.550 --> 00:39:26.980
a feelingless killer.

00:39:28.230 --> 00:39:29.050
I do the job,

00:39:29.400 --> 00:39:30.130
nothing else.

00:39:31.030 --> 00:39:31.460
Uncle Zhe,

00:39:32.710 --> 00:39:33.860
of everyone in the Su family,

00:39:34.150 --> 00:39:35.340
I admire you most.

00:39:36.550 --> 00:39:37.460
Don't you die on me!

00:39:38.150 --> 00:39:38.740
Go get 'em!

00:39:40.670 --> 00:39:42.740
There are three flames on a person's shoulders.

00:39:43.150 --> 00:39:44.050
Don't pat them at random.

00:39:44.190 --> 00:39:45.010
Snuff them out,

00:39:45.150 --> 00:39:46.260
and you really die.

00:40:01.630 --> 00:40:02.610
That hunchback Luo

00:40:03.510 --> 00:40:04.490
is a pain.

00:40:05.510 --> 00:40:06.300
What about the Mus?

00:40:08.630 --> 00:40:09.690
Mu Qingyang and Mu Xuewei

00:40:09.880 --> 00:40:10.860
broke the line for a bit,

00:40:11.280 --> 00:40:12.210
but were stopped.

00:40:12.800 --> 00:40:13.900
The Patriarch left.

00:40:14.630 --> 00:40:15.420
The others were driven back

00:40:16.070 --> 00:40:17.380
by Twelve Zodiacs of Spider Shadow

00:40:17.960 --> 00:40:18.570
and vanished.

00:40:19.150 --> 00:40:20.130
Back to base now,

00:40:21.070 --> 00:40:23.260
and report to Master.

00:40:23.800 --> 00:40:24.210
Yes.

00:40:29.840 --> 00:40:30.900
Su Changhe.

00:40:31.800 --> 00:40:33.170
Xie Fanhua, you sickly ghost.

00:40:34.030 --> 00:40:35.530
What a small world.

00:40:36.630 --> 00:40:37.380
Looks like you lot

00:40:37.400 --> 00:40:38.610
failed at Spider's Nest

00:40:38.800 --> 00:40:39.380
and are in retreat.

00:40:39.920 --> 00:40:40.780
You're here

00:40:41.630 --> 00:40:43.050
to block my way?

00:40:43.360 --> 00:40:44.130
No.

00:40:44.760 --> 00:40:46.460
I'm just going to take a look at Spider's Nest.

00:40:47.070 --> 00:40:49.210
Run into you again by chance.

00:40:50.070 --> 00:40:51.010
If so,

00:40:51.670 --> 00:40:54.780
please step aside, Undertaker.

00:40:55.400 --> 00:40:56.900
You know, I'm an undertaker.

00:40:57.710 --> 00:40:58.210
I didn't come

00:40:58.280 --> 00:40:59.050
specifically for you,

00:40:59.110 --> 00:41:00.210
but since we've met,

00:41:00.760 --> 00:41:01.860
I should pay my respects.

00:41:03.150 --> 00:41:03.570
You are

00:41:03.630 --> 00:41:04.860
a standout of the Xie family,

00:41:05.550 --> 00:41:06.260
so...

00:41:06.840 --> 00:41:08.170
let me see you off.

00:41:08.710 --> 00:41:10.380
Then try.

00:41:41.110 --> 00:41:41.900
Why have you been

00:41:41.920 --> 00:41:42.940
just standing there.

00:41:44.550 --> 00:41:45.210
All together!

00:41:46.110 --> 00:41:46.740
Fanhua,

00:41:47.630 --> 00:41:48.210
I've been

00:41:48.230 --> 00:41:49.610
watching Su Changhe.

00:41:49.840 --> 00:41:50.940
I finally spotted a flaw

00:41:51.760 --> 00:41:53.130
in his Inch Sword.

00:41:53.590 --> 00:41:55.490
Please clear a path for me.

00:41:55.920 --> 00:41:56.780
All right.
