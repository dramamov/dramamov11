00:00:10.048 --> 00:00:11.316
Eiji Kurisu, a tax accountant,

00:00:11.382 --> 00:00:15.587
in an effort to revitalize
the temp company, Royal Human,

00:00:15.653 --> 00:00:18.123
was asked by Mr. Yutaro Sanno,
the head of HR,

00:00:18.189 --> 00:00:21.493
to investigate the unprofitable
Horse Racing Division

00:00:21.559 --> 00:00:22.727
so it could be shut down.

00:00:22.794 --> 00:00:23.661
However…

00:00:23.728 --> 00:00:26.131
Do you have a dream?

00:00:26.197 --> 00:00:31.936
While being messed around with by
the president and horse owner, Kozo Sanno…

00:00:32.003 --> 00:00:35.073
The value of a horse
can't be measured with mere numbers.

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:37.709
This man is your friend, too.

00:00:37.775 --> 00:00:42.013
He got to know the joy of horse racing
and was captivated by it.

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:45.550
If no owner can be found to take them in,

00:00:45.617 --> 00:00:47.619
they'll likely be put down.

00:00:49.053 --> 00:00:50.121
Put down?

00:00:50.188 --> 00:00:55.260
In order to keep them as racehorses,
he went against Yutaro's plan

00:00:55.326 --> 00:00:58.129
and decided to help
the Horse Racing Division.

00:00:58.196 --> 00:00:59.898
This is an act of embezzlement!

00:01:00.465 --> 00:01:04.936
Personally,I'd like Mr. Sanno
to stay in the horse racing world.

00:01:05.003 --> 00:01:05.837
Go!

00:01:06.404 --> 00:01:08.606
-Go!
-Go!

00:01:08.673 --> 00:01:10.875
After seeing a serious race
by Royal Fight,

00:01:10.942 --> 00:01:13.111
who had just avoided being sold…

00:01:13.178 --> 00:01:16.881
For the first time, I've done something
that earned someone's gratitude.

00:01:16.948 --> 00:01:18.416
Want to come over to my place?

00:01:18.483 --> 00:01:19.951
You've got no place to go, right?

00:01:20.018 --> 00:01:21.953
I want to win
the nation's top Grade I race

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:23.922
and make our horse the best in Japan.

00:01:23.988 --> 00:01:25.456
At the Arima Kinen.

00:01:25.523 --> 00:01:26.991
Want to give it a try?

00:01:27.058 --> 00:01:29.594
In exchange, you must never betray me.

00:01:30.161 --> 00:01:31.362
Understood.

00:01:31.996 --> 00:01:37.402
He quit his job at the accounting firm
and chose to work with Kozo Sanno, but…

00:01:37.468 --> 00:01:39.737
The tax accountant acted unexpectedly.

00:01:39.804 --> 00:01:41.472
Think about what to do next.

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:45.243
You have to protect that company.

00:01:51.983 --> 00:01:53.418
Oh, you're here.

00:01:53.484 --> 00:01:54.419
President.

00:01:54.485 --> 00:01:55.420
Do you know about him?

00:01:55.486 --> 00:01:56.788
I do.

00:01:57.722 --> 00:01:59.724
First, read through
all the horse documents.

00:01:59.791 --> 00:02:02.227
Wait. Look at this.

00:02:02.727 --> 00:02:05.196
"Horse Racing Division,
Private Secretary."

00:02:05.263 --> 00:02:07.465
I had them made for you. Pass them out.

00:02:07.532 --> 00:02:09.400
I thought I was to be an accountant.

00:02:09.467 --> 00:02:10.902
-Morning.
-Good morning.

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:12.270
I'm a tax accountant.

00:02:12.337 --> 00:02:14.639
I don't know anything about horses.

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:16.674
It's fine.

00:02:16.741 --> 00:02:20.011
Since a tax man is here,
everyone will think we're doing fine.

00:02:20.078 --> 00:02:21.312
It's camouflage.

00:02:21.379 --> 00:02:22.180
What?

00:02:22.247 --> 00:02:24.315
Sir, we need to hurry
for your next meeting.

00:02:24.382 --> 00:02:25.250
Right.

00:02:25.316 --> 00:02:27.819
-All right, we're departing at five.
-What?

00:02:29.354 --> 00:02:30.922
Let's win a G1!

00:02:32.423 --> 00:02:34.292
I've prepared a spot for you.

00:02:34.359 --> 00:02:35.026
Okay.

00:02:35.093 --> 00:02:35.893
HORSE RACING DIVISION

00:02:41.733 --> 00:02:43.534
-Welcome home.
-Thanks.

00:02:50.074 --> 00:02:50.908
Come.

00:02:50.975 --> 00:02:53.578
It's your official introduction. Come on.

00:02:59.651 --> 00:03:01.519
Is it not to your liking?

00:03:01.586 --> 00:03:02.520
What?

00:03:02.587 --> 00:03:05.056
You haven't touched the wine at all.

00:03:05.123 --> 00:03:06.357
Oh, no.

00:03:06.924 --> 00:03:08.393
I shouldn't get drunk.

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:09.627
Why?

00:03:09.694 --> 00:03:11.029
-Please drink.
-Hey.

00:03:11.095 --> 00:03:12.263
Where's Yutaro?

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:13.398
I don't know.

00:03:13.965 --> 00:03:15.600
He doesn't even read my messages.

00:03:16.134 --> 00:03:17.835
Just like his father.

00:03:17.902 --> 00:03:19.137
A workaholic.

00:03:19.203 --> 00:03:21.306
A migratory fish
that dies if it ever stops.

00:03:21.806 --> 00:03:23.074
I'm sorry.

00:03:23.141 --> 00:03:25.310
That not all of us could be present here.

00:03:25.376 --> 00:03:27.378
Oh, it's nothing. Thank you.

00:03:27.445 --> 00:03:28.846
Still, we're lucky.

00:03:29.414 --> 00:03:31.983
We were able to find
a new manager right away.

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:34.385
And it's someone your type.

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:36.988
-In what way?
-Come on.

00:03:37.055 --> 00:03:38.856
The obedient type.

00:03:39.424 --> 00:03:41.225
He will follow you into hell.

00:03:41.292 --> 00:03:43.361
-Come on.
-What you're doing is gambling.

00:03:44.062 --> 00:03:45.163
Mr. Kurisu, too.

00:03:45.763 --> 00:03:47.065
Please control yourself.

00:03:47.131 --> 00:03:49.000
Hey. That's enough already.

00:03:58.242 --> 00:03:59.544
-Mr. Yamada.
-Yes?

00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:01.379
-May I get some water?
-Yes, Miss.

00:04:06.217 --> 00:04:07.185
Well…

00:04:08.319 --> 00:04:13.057
I actually have an old friend
who's in the ranch business.

00:04:13.124 --> 00:04:14.258
Horse ranch?

00:04:14.325 --> 00:04:15.259
Yes.

00:04:15.827 --> 00:04:17.562
A family farm in Hidaka.

00:04:18.262 --> 00:04:23.034
My friend said their role is to protect
the possibility of evolution

00:04:23.101 --> 00:04:25.436
and pass it on to future generations.

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:28.773
And if so, I think my role

00:04:30.074 --> 00:04:32.543
may be to safely advance
the president's horses

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:34.879
to the next race.

00:04:36.114 --> 00:04:37.882
Sorry, I'm rambling.

00:04:40.218 --> 00:04:41.953
You're a cocky one.

00:04:45.890 --> 00:04:47.225
On the rocks, sir?

00:04:47.291 --> 00:04:49.093
Oh, don't worry about me.

00:04:49.894 --> 00:04:51.062
Don't be shy.

00:04:51.629 --> 00:04:53.931
Mr. Yamada, I'll have one, water-diluted.

00:04:53.998 --> 00:04:54.932
Yes, sir.

00:04:54.999 --> 00:04:56.367
You'll have the same, right?

00:04:56.934 --> 00:04:57.769
Yes.

00:04:57.835 --> 00:04:59.670
-Make his weaker.
-Understood.

00:04:59.737 --> 00:05:00.638
Let me do it.

00:05:00.705 --> 00:05:01.372
YUTARO

00:05:01.439 --> 00:05:02.640
It's alright.

00:05:04.609 --> 00:05:05.943
I'm tired.

00:05:08.346 --> 00:05:10.148
They'll say lots of things about us.

00:05:10.748 --> 00:05:12.650
But don't let it get to you.

00:05:14.152 --> 00:05:16.354
Our horse division
isn't the only one in the red.

00:05:16.421 --> 00:05:18.890
How dare they act
like they're better than us?

00:05:19.524 --> 00:05:20.691
I spent today

00:05:21.492 --> 00:05:24.695
going through the documents left
by my predecessor, Mr. Kaneshiro.

00:05:25.663 --> 00:05:27.498
They were very well-organized.

00:05:30.201 --> 00:05:32.170
Does that excuse what he did?

00:05:33.471 --> 00:05:34.806
Of course not.

00:05:34.872 --> 00:05:37.675
What Mr. Kaneshiro did was inexcusable.

00:05:38.443 --> 00:05:39.510
However…

00:05:40.812 --> 00:05:45.049
I won't waste those documents
and use them in my own way.

00:05:45.817 --> 00:05:48.853
There are still lots of things
I don't know.

00:05:49.420 --> 00:05:51.722
Please bear with me.

00:05:54.926 --> 00:05:56.928
Why are you being so formal now?

00:05:59.630 --> 00:06:03.634
Uncomfortable situations, like today,
are also part of your job.

00:06:04.202 --> 00:06:05.269
Don't forget that.

00:06:06.037 --> 00:06:09.340
If possible, I'd like to focus
only on the horses going forward.

00:06:09.407 --> 00:06:10.708
That's a no.

00:06:12.777 --> 00:06:14.178
All right, here.

00:06:14.779 --> 00:06:16.113
-Cheers.
-Yes.

00:06:17.148 --> 00:06:19.050
Don't you ever betray me.

00:06:19.116 --> 00:06:20.351
Yes.

00:06:28.626 --> 00:06:29.727
Mr. Kurisu!

00:06:29.794 --> 00:06:31.462
-Yes?
-I'll take you home.

00:06:32.129 --> 00:06:33.798
-Oh, it's fine!
-No.

00:06:33.865 --> 00:06:35.533
-No, but…
-I'll get scolded.

00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:37.134
In that case…

00:06:37.201 --> 00:06:40.104
-Sorry for the trouble.
-It's fine.

00:06:40.638 --> 00:06:41.572
Go ahead.

00:06:43.474 --> 00:06:46.043
Please accept this as well.

00:06:46.110 --> 00:06:47.245
What?

00:06:47.311 --> 00:06:49.547
The president said to give it to you.

00:06:50.882 --> 00:06:53.184
He said it's a gift for your new job.

00:06:56.354 --> 00:06:57.321
Oh, wow.

00:07:01.893 --> 00:07:04.295
-Ms. Takeda!
-Hello, sir!

00:07:05.463 --> 00:07:06.764
I had Advertising estimate

00:07:06.831 --> 00:07:09.400
the cost-effectiveness
of our racing business.

00:07:10.101 --> 00:07:11.402
These are the results.

00:07:12.303 --> 00:07:13.671
Unfortunately,

00:07:13.738 --> 00:07:17.241
no matter how much Royal's horses run,
they won't be good advertising for us.

00:07:17.308 --> 00:07:18.776
And why is that?

00:07:19.810 --> 00:07:20.711
They don't win.

00:07:21.312 --> 00:07:25.917
Unless a horse wins several famous races,
no one will pay attention to it.

00:07:25.983 --> 00:07:27.585
You never give up, huh?

00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:33.558
The department's continuation was
only just approved at the last meeting.

00:07:33.624 --> 00:07:35.593
Of course, I respect that.

00:07:35.660 --> 00:07:37.628
However, the young employees won't wait.

00:07:38.195 --> 00:07:40.498
They say, "We're hounded for KPIs,

00:07:40.565 --> 00:07:43.901
while the horses are let off the hook
no matter how much they lose."

00:07:46.037 --> 00:07:48.005
So I have a proposal.

00:07:49.640 --> 00:07:53.711
Win one central race within the year.

00:07:54.512 --> 00:07:55.813
Just one win is fine.

00:07:55.880 --> 00:07:57.248
Just once.

00:07:57.315 --> 00:07:59.817
If a Royal horse gets a win,

00:07:59.884 --> 00:08:02.887
we can use that to reassure
the young employees.

00:08:02.954 --> 00:08:05.957
However, if you can't win even once,

00:08:06.891 --> 00:08:09.527
the department will be abolished
by the year's end.

00:08:10.294 --> 00:08:11.829
-How about it?
-Wait!

00:08:11.896 --> 00:08:13.698
"Just one win is fine."

00:08:14.398 --> 00:08:15.866
You say it so easily.

00:08:16.434 --> 00:08:21.439
Even now, hundreds of thousands of horses
are working their tails off to win.

00:08:21.505 --> 00:08:22.907
Interesting.

00:08:23.741 --> 00:08:24.575
Let's try it.

00:08:24.642 --> 00:08:25.509
President!

00:08:25.576 --> 00:08:27.445
Don't underestimate our horses.

00:08:27.511 --> 00:08:30.715
Then I'll take that as your consent.

00:08:33.351 --> 00:08:34.251
Just in case.

00:08:35.519 --> 00:08:38.456
I know this is a tough first task,
but I wish you the best of luck.

00:08:44.729 --> 00:08:48.332
Are you sure it's a good idea, President?
Agreeing to his proposal.

00:08:49.333 --> 00:08:52.803
He didn't say we had to win a G1.

00:08:53.404 --> 00:08:55.640
A win in any race is a win.

00:08:57.675 --> 00:08:58.876
Don't worry.

00:08:59.877 --> 00:09:01.479
We have one that might.

00:09:02.079 --> 00:09:03.214
Fight.

00:09:03.280 --> 00:09:07.818
At this time,
Kozo Sanno owned a total of 11 horses,

00:09:07.885 --> 00:09:10.788
including the yearlings
he had just purchased.

00:09:10.855 --> 00:09:14.158
However,
they were mares that had been retired,

00:09:14.225 --> 00:09:16.694
mid-level horses
whose performances had plateaued,

00:09:16.761 --> 00:09:21.065
or two-year-olds troubled by injuries
with no clear debut in sight.

00:09:21.132 --> 00:09:23.167
Few of them had strategic value.

00:09:23.234 --> 00:09:27.004
The only one with potential was the one
who finished second in the Niigata race.

00:09:27.071 --> 00:09:28.939
Royal Fight.

00:09:29.440 --> 00:09:33.310
After the 400-meter mark, Number Four,
Royal Fight has gained speed!

00:09:33.377 --> 00:09:35.312
From sixth to fifth, now fourth place!

00:09:35.379 --> 00:09:36.380
Third place now!

00:09:36.447 --> 00:09:38.849
Charging straight!
Will Royal Fight make it?

00:09:38.916 --> 00:09:40.418
-Go!
-Go!

00:09:44.288 --> 00:09:46.290
We'll expedite his training

00:09:46.991 --> 00:09:49.326
and have Fight run
in as many races as possible.

00:09:50.361 --> 00:09:52.430
We go to the training center tomorrow.

00:09:52.496 --> 00:09:53.831
Get ready to go to Miho.

00:09:54.432 --> 00:09:55.433
Yes, sir.

00:10:23.461 --> 00:10:24.962
A bit of a special horse.

00:10:25.029 --> 00:10:27.631
She has a crooked leg.

00:10:27.698 --> 00:10:29.767
That kind of horse usually doesn't sell.

00:10:29.834 --> 00:10:32.737
With a leg like that,
there's no guarantee they can run.

00:10:41.645 --> 00:10:42.980
A racehorse.

00:10:43.047 --> 00:10:48.452
Generally, thoroughbreds born in Japan
that enter a national race,

00:10:49.153 --> 00:10:53.290
are purchased by owners
at a breeding farm,

00:10:53.357 --> 00:10:55.459
and trained at a specialized facility

00:10:55.526 --> 00:10:58.596
to learn the fundamentals
of being a racehorse.

00:10:59.230 --> 00:11:02.533
In addition, the owner
selects a trainer to entrust its care to,

00:11:03.334 --> 00:11:05.870
and as the horse grows,
it is moved from the farm

00:11:05.936 --> 00:11:08.005
to a training center.

00:11:08.072 --> 00:11:12.409
Only horses that are registered there
can take part in actual races.

00:11:12.476 --> 00:11:13.410
Morning, Fight.

00:11:13.477 --> 00:11:14.845
For a horse,

00:11:14.912 --> 00:11:17.748
this is as tough as entering
a top-tier elite school

00:11:17.815 --> 00:11:22.119
and overcoming numerous trials
to enter society.

00:11:22.186 --> 00:11:27.691
Their race
starts the moment they are born.

00:11:28.425 --> 00:11:31.896
ROYAL IZANA

00:11:52.817 --> 00:11:54.218
Quite a view, huh?

00:11:55.085 --> 00:11:59.456
Every horse here is elite, trained to win.

00:12:07.364 --> 00:12:09.533
Let's go see Tadokoro.

00:12:09.600 --> 00:12:10.534
Okay.

00:12:18.008 --> 00:12:19.109
Good morning.

00:12:36.760 --> 00:12:39.063
That's why I'm telling you to move it up!

00:12:39.129 --> 00:12:40.331
It's impossible!

00:12:40.397 --> 00:12:43.667
We were preparing
for the race in two weeks' time.

00:12:43.734 --> 00:12:45.603
Fight can't be ready on time!

00:12:45.669 --> 00:12:49.039
First place isn't something
you can get so easily!

00:12:49.106 --> 00:12:51.275
It's the trainer's job
to aim for that, isn't it?

00:12:51.342 --> 00:12:53.344
All horses are bred to win.

00:12:53.410 --> 00:12:56.914
That's precisely why we must
follow the right procedures.

00:12:56.981 --> 00:12:59.516
Horses are living creatures. Not machines.

00:12:59.583 --> 00:13:03.153
Every horse has its own personality
and the right way to train it.

00:13:03.220 --> 00:13:05.489
Seeing to that is our job as trainers!

00:13:05.556 --> 00:13:07.691
Oh, quit babbling on.

00:13:07.758 --> 00:13:09.126
-What?
-Fine!

00:13:09.760 --> 00:13:10.928
-I'll find another.
-What?

00:13:10.995 --> 00:13:12.963
-We'll change stables.
-What?

00:13:13.030 --> 00:13:16.233
-Let's look for another one.
-Wait, President! Wait…

00:13:17.034 --> 00:13:17.935
I'm so sorry.

00:13:18.002 --> 00:13:20.437
I'll consult with him again
after he's calmed down.

00:13:20.504 --> 00:13:21.805
It's impossible.

00:13:22.539 --> 00:13:23.607
I can't work with him!

00:13:23.674 --> 00:13:24.575
What?

00:13:24.642 --> 00:13:26.844
I've been very patient with him too.

00:13:26.911 --> 00:13:28.746
I've had enough of his whims.

00:13:29.413 --> 00:13:31.815
If you change Fight,
Izana goes with him, right?

00:13:31.882 --> 00:13:33.617
No, but…

00:13:33.684 --> 00:13:35.819
They need you, Mr. Tadokoro.

00:13:35.886 --> 00:13:39.023
It's all right.
Another trainer can do just as well.

00:13:39.089 --> 00:13:40.057
They're a calm bunch.

00:13:44.395 --> 00:13:46.931
I did my best to care for them. My utmost.

00:13:47.531 --> 00:13:50.534
But to want a first-place win right away?

00:13:51.268 --> 00:13:53.470
No offence to the Hayashida Ranch,

00:13:53.537 --> 00:13:57.007
but those horses, they're like commoners,
thrown in among the elites.

00:13:58.609 --> 00:14:01.745
You should prioritize giving them
a good life over trying to win.

00:14:01.812 --> 00:14:03.314
Especially Izana.

00:14:15.426 --> 00:14:17.594
SORYU CO. CEO

00:14:20.998 --> 00:14:22.566
Alright.

00:14:23.600 --> 00:14:24.568
Oh, sir.

00:14:25.069 --> 00:14:26.236
We just arrived.

00:14:26.971 --> 00:14:29.606
No. Thank you.

00:14:29.673 --> 00:14:31.208
Okay. Thank you.

00:14:32.009 --> 00:14:35.145
This is a horse we purchased
at the Hokuryo auction last year.

00:14:35.813 --> 00:14:37.247
This one…

00:14:37.948 --> 00:14:39.783
It's worth 230 million yen.

00:14:39.850 --> 00:14:42.886
I took a look at it
and thought it was amazing.

00:14:42.953 --> 00:14:45.055
It's stabled at Hokuryo for now,

00:14:45.122 --> 00:14:49.526
but I'd like to have this one race
as soon as possible.

00:14:49.593 --> 00:14:50.661
Why?

00:14:51.628 --> 00:14:53.931
They're the type
that grows with experience.

00:14:54.665 --> 00:14:57.768
If it doesn't see faster horses,
it won't try to run fast.

00:14:57.835 --> 00:15:00.237
Of course, we must win,

00:15:00.304 --> 00:15:02.873
but I'd like to enjoy watching it
mature in the races.

00:15:02.940 --> 00:15:04.808
With you.

00:15:05.542 --> 00:15:06.510
How about it?

00:15:07.044 --> 00:15:09.847
Won't you accept
one of our offers already, sir?

00:15:10.614 --> 00:15:14.651
-Oh, please stop calling me "sir."
-A trainer manages racehorses.

00:15:14.718 --> 00:15:18.555
There is a limit to the number
of racehorses a trainer can manage,

00:15:19.256 --> 00:15:24.628
and trainers with many wins naturally
receive a lot of requests and good horses.

00:15:24.695 --> 00:15:26.163
Do you know Ogino?

00:15:26.230 --> 00:15:27.197
What?

00:15:27.865 --> 00:15:28.699
Ogino.

00:15:29.233 --> 00:15:31.035
The leading trainer last year.

00:15:32.202 --> 00:15:34.638
Tateaki Ogino, I think?

00:15:34.705 --> 00:15:35.973
I'm afraid I don't.

00:15:37.574 --> 00:15:39.009
Do your homework first!

00:15:39.076 --> 00:15:41.345
He's the top-ranking trainer right now.

00:15:41.412 --> 00:15:44.882
-We're just going to talk to him?
-Enough. Just look him up already!

00:15:44.948 --> 00:15:48.018
Wow, owners like him are the worst.

00:15:52.189 --> 00:15:53.891
Just do as you're told!

00:15:53.957 --> 00:15:55.125
I'm sorry.

00:16:01.865 --> 00:16:03.267
Excuse me.

00:16:03.333 --> 00:16:05.602
Mr. Ogino is extremely busy right now.

00:16:05.669 --> 00:16:07.871
It's fine, thank you
for making time for us.

00:16:07.938 --> 00:16:08.906
It's nothing.

00:16:10.174 --> 00:16:11.542
My name is Kurisu.

00:16:12.776 --> 00:16:15.045
You manage the Royal horses?

00:16:15.112 --> 00:16:17.181
Yes. Oh, the documents.

00:16:17.848 --> 00:16:20.984
Mr. Ogino is truly amazing.

00:16:21.051 --> 00:16:23.454
Ten horses just for this weekend's races?

00:16:23.520 --> 00:16:24.922
I expected nothing less.

00:16:25.622 --> 00:16:30.427
These two horses are from the same ranch
and were purchased together,

00:16:30.494 --> 00:16:32.729
so I figured they should be
transferred together.

00:16:32.796 --> 00:16:33.797
I apologize.

00:16:34.465 --> 00:16:36.333
You came all this way.

00:16:36.400 --> 00:16:40.037
Our policy is to meet in person
and hear the details.

00:16:40.104 --> 00:16:43.540
However right now,
Mr. Ogino has no vacancies.

00:16:47.244 --> 00:16:49.847
Thank you. We'll try others.

00:16:50.848 --> 00:16:51.815
Hey.

00:16:52.649 --> 00:16:54.551
Sorry if I'm being nosy, but…

00:16:54.618 --> 00:16:58.522
This year's Maiden Race ends
in the first week of October, doesn't it?

00:17:00.357 --> 00:17:01.959
It does, you know. In October.

00:17:02.025 --> 00:17:05.629
Of course, if you miss that,
you can still enter other races.

00:17:05.696 --> 00:17:10.300
But it will be a harder fight
for the horses.

00:17:12.903 --> 00:17:14.037
Excuse me.

00:17:17.207 --> 00:17:19.710
The Maiden Race, as the name suggests,

00:17:19.776 --> 00:17:24.448
is a race for horses
that have never won before.

00:17:25.249 --> 00:17:29.086
Most horses that haven't won a maiden race
by the autumn of their third year

00:17:29.153 --> 00:17:33.524
are forced to transfer
to local racing or retire.

00:17:38.061 --> 00:17:39.897
Oh, excuse me.

00:17:39.963 --> 00:17:43.300
Is Mr. Sugimoto's stable up ahead?

00:17:43.367 --> 00:17:44.968
That's right.

00:17:50.374 --> 00:17:53.210
Their owner has a bad reputation,
you know.

00:17:53.277 --> 00:17:54.211
What?

00:17:55.646 --> 00:17:57.614
You should trust the staff.

00:17:59.483 --> 00:18:02.252
Mr. Sugimoto's stable
is on the next left turn.

00:18:03.120 --> 00:18:04.454
Excuse me.

00:18:08.692 --> 00:18:13.130
During that time, Fight and Izana,
with nowhere to transfer to,

00:18:13.697 --> 00:18:17.768
were moved to a nearby ranch
which serves as an external stable.

00:18:24.408 --> 00:18:25.542
Let's eat.

00:18:26.944 --> 00:18:28.712
We need to change strategies.

00:18:30.047 --> 00:18:32.382
Finding a stable just for Fight
should be easy.

00:18:33.784 --> 00:18:34.618
What?

00:18:35.586 --> 00:18:38.655
Are you saying we keep Fight
and Izana in separate stables?

00:18:40.324 --> 00:18:41.325
Listen.

00:18:42.259 --> 00:18:44.995
Though they share a stable,
they can't be together forever.

00:18:45.062 --> 00:18:49.266
Once they become racehorses,
in a way, they're all alone.

00:18:50.234 --> 00:18:51.068
But…

00:18:51.134 --> 00:18:53.503
First place, at all costs. Right?

00:18:54.304 --> 00:18:58.575
In any case, if Fight can't win,
they'll be separated anyway.

00:18:58.642 --> 00:19:01.778
Reevaluate. We need a trainer who can win.

00:19:03.981 --> 00:19:05.849
Say, "I understand."

00:19:12.289 --> 00:19:13.890
I under…

00:19:16.226 --> 00:19:17.461
I can't.

00:19:18.428 --> 00:19:20.364
-What did you say?
-Of course.

00:19:20.430 --> 00:19:22.966
As you said, I will prioritize Fight.

00:19:23.033 --> 00:19:27.070
But I myself hate this idea.
I want to inform you of that. Sorry.

00:19:29.606 --> 00:19:31.174
You're so cocky.

00:19:56.733 --> 00:19:57.601
Yeah.

00:19:58.835 --> 00:19:59.670
Yeah.

00:19:59.736 --> 00:20:00.704
KANAKO'S SON

00:20:00.771 --> 00:20:01.938
It's a game.

00:20:02.005 --> 00:20:03.206
3DS.

00:20:03.740 --> 00:20:05.242
-They have it in Tokyo.
-Hey.

00:20:05.309 --> 00:20:06.843
-Kyohei.
-I'm home.

00:20:06.910 --> 00:20:08.879
3DS!

00:20:09.446 --> 00:20:10.514
3DS!

00:20:10.580 --> 00:20:11.815
-Thank you.
-Your total is…

00:20:11.882 --> 00:20:13.550
-Cheers!
-Thanks.

00:20:18.955 --> 00:20:21.458
-This is yummy.
-Yes, the best!

00:20:23.260 --> 00:20:24.461
Okay.

00:20:25.062 --> 00:20:26.096
-Hey.
-Yes?

00:20:26.163 --> 00:20:27.964
You don't live around here, do you?

00:20:28.031 --> 00:20:30.167
No, my workplace is just nearby.

00:20:30.233 --> 00:20:32.202
Gosh, I was so scared.

00:20:33.236 --> 00:20:34.771
Let me see your business card.

00:20:34.838 --> 00:20:36.173
Oh, sure.

00:20:39.376 --> 00:20:40.243
Here.

00:20:43.180 --> 00:20:47.017
Oh, my. "Royal Human.
Horse Racing Division, Private Secretary."

00:20:47.084 --> 00:20:49.152
Don't say it out loud!

00:20:49.219 --> 00:20:52.656
I can't believe
you came over to this side.

00:20:52.723 --> 00:20:54.024
Seriously.

00:20:54.091 --> 00:20:56.760
How are things on your end?
Tomorrow's race?

00:20:56.827 --> 00:20:59.529
I have a jinx that if I go watch
the race, my horse will win.

00:20:59.596 --> 00:21:01.031
Oh, really?

00:21:01.098 --> 00:21:02.666
Then come watch our race too.

00:21:02.733 --> 00:21:05.435
Though it's limited
to the horses bred at my farm.

00:21:05.502 --> 00:21:06.470
What the heck?

00:21:07.037 --> 00:21:09.373
Besides, that jinx
was already broken long ago.

00:21:09.439 --> 00:21:10.340
What?

00:21:10.407 --> 00:21:13.276
But doesn't thinking that way
give you courage?

00:21:13.343 --> 00:21:15.445
"I've never lost," or something like that.

00:21:15.512 --> 00:21:16.913
What the heck is that?

00:21:17.514 --> 00:21:18.615
Thank you.

00:21:22.919 --> 00:21:24.020
Wait, really?

00:21:24.588 --> 00:21:26.022
-Is it good?
-Yum!

00:21:29.526 --> 00:21:30.427
Yeah.

00:21:31.428 --> 00:21:34.264
I can't believe I used to work
in a city like this.

00:21:36.133 --> 00:21:38.435
Is ten years that long?

00:21:38.502 --> 00:21:39.469
Yes.

00:21:40.137 --> 00:21:41.805
Oh, right.

00:21:41.872 --> 00:21:42.939
Shohei.

00:21:43.006 --> 00:21:44.141
Shohei, my son.

00:21:44.207 --> 00:21:45.842
Oh, right. Shohei.

00:21:46.476 --> 00:21:51.181
When I told him I was going to Tokyo,
he got really mad.

00:21:51.248 --> 00:21:53.116
Divorces are awkward like that.

00:21:55.018 --> 00:21:57.521
I promised to send him photos
and get him a souvenir.

00:21:57.587 --> 00:21:59.322
-Take a nice picture of me.
-Sure.

00:21:59.389 --> 00:22:01.858
-Oh, do you want to be in it?
-No, I shouldn't.

00:22:01.925 --> 00:22:04.094
Oh? Really?

00:22:04.161 --> 00:22:06.296
Here, thank you for waiting.

00:22:06.863 --> 00:22:10.567
Honestly, I really don't know
what to do anymore.

00:22:11.868 --> 00:22:15.038
All you've got is a Hidaka horse
with no wins.

00:22:15.605 --> 00:22:17.908
The trainer bets his life on his horses.

00:22:19.242 --> 00:22:22.245
If I'm going to take a horse,
I want one from a famous ranch

00:22:22.746 --> 00:22:25.015
with good breeding and lineage.

00:22:25.081 --> 00:22:26.616
Like Hokuryo Farm.

00:22:27.451 --> 00:22:29.553
You're from Hidaka, though.

00:22:30.120 --> 00:22:32.088
I'm not self-deprecating.

00:22:32.155 --> 00:22:33.423
It's the reality.

00:22:33.490 --> 00:22:37.828
But there are trainers with a philosophy.

00:22:39.996 --> 00:22:44.034
Not just winning, but how to win,
and what horse to win with.

00:22:45.068 --> 00:22:48.071
There are many trainers
who are particular about that.

00:22:49.206 --> 00:22:50.240
For example?

00:22:52.976 --> 00:22:54.144
Please.

00:22:55.345 --> 00:22:56.813
We're on a cliff's edge.

00:22:57.581 --> 00:23:00.484
I want Fight to win.

00:23:04.020 --> 00:23:08.258
Well, I can think of one person,

00:23:09.960 --> 00:23:11.161
but he's a weirdo.

00:23:11.928 --> 00:23:12.929
What?

00:23:26.009 --> 00:23:30.680
HIRONAKA STABLE

00:23:30.747 --> 00:23:31.915
Here you go.

00:23:32.716 --> 00:23:34.518
Eat up.

00:23:34.584 --> 00:23:35.418
Huh?

00:23:36.186 --> 00:23:38.154
My notebook is gone.

00:23:40.557 --> 00:23:42.125
It's gone.

00:23:44.895 --> 00:23:46.997
Yoshida, my notebook is gone.

00:23:47.063 --> 00:23:48.198
I don't know.

00:23:48.265 --> 00:23:50.033
-You haven't seen it?
-No.

00:23:50.667 --> 00:23:51.668
Excuse me, sorry.

00:23:52.269 --> 00:23:53.503
Excuse me.

00:23:53.570 --> 00:23:54.738
-Excuse me!
-What?

00:23:54.804 --> 00:23:58.375
-I'm Kurisu, from Royal Human…
-Mr. Royal!

00:24:02.412 --> 00:24:03.246
Excuse me.

00:24:03.313 --> 00:24:04.648
Nice to meet you.

00:24:04.714 --> 00:24:05.615
I'm Hironaka.

00:24:05.682 --> 00:24:06.816
Hello.

00:24:06.883 --> 00:24:07.951
Come in.

00:24:08.451 --> 00:24:09.486
Thank you.

00:24:10.053 --> 00:24:11.021
HIRONAKA STABLE

00:24:11.087 --> 00:24:12.856
This way, please.

00:24:12.923 --> 00:24:14.090
Excuse me.

00:24:18.028 --> 00:24:19.195
Oh, come in!

00:24:19.262 --> 00:24:21.231
Here, if you would like…

00:24:21.298 --> 00:24:23.133
Thank you very much.

00:24:23.199 --> 00:24:25.101
-It's nothing much, sir…
-Oh, don't!

00:24:25.168 --> 00:24:27.270
-Don't call me "sir."
-What?

00:24:27.337 --> 00:24:29.472
Hironaka. Just Hironaka is fine.

00:24:29.539 --> 00:24:32.242
-Understood.
-Please wait a moment.

00:24:32.842 --> 00:24:35.712
I lost the data for the horse
running two days from now.

00:24:35.779 --> 00:24:36.846
-What?
-Oh, no!

00:24:36.913 --> 00:24:39.316
-It's still on the computer, but…
-Found it!

00:24:39.382 --> 00:24:40.417
I prefer handwritten.

00:24:40.483 --> 00:24:41.851
-I can…
-Found it!

00:24:41.918 --> 00:24:42.986
Where?

00:24:43.053 --> 00:24:44.087
In the car.

00:24:44.154 --> 00:24:46.356
-What?
-I wasted an hour!

00:24:46.423 --> 00:24:47.257
What?

00:24:47.324 --> 00:24:50.160
-It took me an hour to look for that.
-Sorry.

00:24:50.226 --> 00:24:51.828
I put the horse blankets out.

00:24:51.895 --> 00:24:53.196
-Oh, thank you!
-Sure.

00:24:53.263 --> 00:24:54.364
You're amazing.

00:24:54.864 --> 00:24:56.366
I have a vacancy, you know.

00:24:56.933 --> 00:25:00.070
I was also looking for a good horse.

00:25:00.136 --> 00:25:02.105
I see. Well…

00:25:02.672 --> 00:25:04.407
In the last race, in Niigata,
he came in second…

00:25:04.474 --> 00:25:05.642
Its lineage?

00:25:06.977 --> 00:25:10.447
Oh, I guess I can read this and find out.

00:25:10.513 --> 00:25:13.016
Yes, I prepared these materials for you.

00:25:13.083 --> 00:25:13.950
Okay.

00:25:14.517 --> 00:25:15.752
ROYAL FIGHT

00:25:16.786 --> 00:25:21.992
For the race this weekend,
I'll come to greet you with the owner.

00:25:22.058 --> 00:25:24.894
-Please…
-Leave that for after we have a deal.

00:25:24.961 --> 00:25:25.795
See you.

00:25:26.830 --> 00:25:27.931
Oh, are we done…

00:25:27.998 --> 00:25:33.103
There's nothing left but to go over
the files. I'll let you know my answer.

00:25:35.405 --> 00:25:36.640
Goodbye.

00:25:43.046 --> 00:25:44.814
Thank you very much.

00:25:47.350 --> 00:25:49.352
-Thank you for this.
-Yes.

00:25:49.919 --> 00:25:51.054
Goodbye.

00:25:53.723 --> 00:25:55.759
Well, then, let's proceed with this.

00:25:55.825 --> 00:25:56.660
Understood.

00:25:56.726 --> 00:25:59.429
-Thank you.
-Thank you very much.

00:25:59.496 --> 00:26:01.364
-Thank you for today.
-See you.

00:26:01.431 --> 00:26:02.899
Thank you very much.

00:26:06.770 --> 00:26:07.604
He's arrived.

00:26:10.206 --> 00:26:13.710
I'm sorry for calling you here.

00:26:15.078 --> 00:26:18.114
You won't be going back
to the office, right?

00:26:18.181 --> 00:26:19.149
Yes.

00:26:19.215 --> 00:26:21.418
Then you can have a drink.

00:26:22.752 --> 00:26:23.720
Don't hold back.

00:26:24.454 --> 00:26:25.622
I'm much obliged.

00:26:27.991 --> 00:26:34.731
The other day, my family was present,
so we couldn't talk much.

00:26:47.077 --> 00:26:53.116
You know, I am in charge
of the F&B department.

00:26:53.183 --> 00:26:55.852
I would like to ask you to transfer there.

00:26:56.352 --> 00:26:59.622
Rest assured that the position
and salary will be satisfactory.

00:26:59.689 --> 00:27:02.058
-I can guarantee that.
-Wait. This amount is…

00:27:02.125 --> 00:27:06.062
My eldest son is in charge of HR,
so there will be no issues.

00:27:07.197 --> 00:27:12.769
He highly regards you, Mr. Kurisu,
as a person with great enthusiasm.

00:27:14.537 --> 00:27:19.976
This will enable you
to showcase your full potential.

00:27:21.878 --> 00:27:24.614
But the Horse Racing Division…

00:27:24.681 --> 00:27:28.051
It's having trouble
finding a trainer, right?

00:27:28.785 --> 00:27:31.521
I wonder if they can win within the year.

00:27:33.356 --> 00:27:36.793
You shouldn't let
your valuable skills go to waste.

00:27:41.231 --> 00:27:43.767
May I ask you one thing?

00:27:44.434 --> 00:27:45.335
Go ahead.

00:27:46.503 --> 00:27:49.539
Do you hate it?

00:27:50.273 --> 00:27:51.441
Horse racing.

00:27:53.443 --> 00:27:54.344
Yes.

00:27:54.410 --> 00:27:56.212
I loathe it.

00:28:25.642 --> 00:28:27.043
Were you drinking yesterday?

00:28:27.844 --> 00:28:28.812
What?

00:28:29.479 --> 00:28:31.648
You didn't answer my call last night.

00:28:32.882 --> 00:28:34.617
You're my secretary, you know.

00:28:35.552 --> 00:28:36.686
Were you out drinking?

00:28:38.855 --> 00:28:39.823
No way.

00:28:40.356 --> 00:28:42.325
I'm a lightweight, sir.

00:28:42.392 --> 00:28:43.326
I was at home.

00:28:44.694 --> 00:28:46.029
Then that's even worse!

00:28:46.095 --> 00:28:47.530
Is that bad?

00:28:47.597 --> 00:28:48.631
Of course it is.

00:28:48.698 --> 00:28:50.800
Why were you just lounging around at home?

00:28:52.101 --> 00:28:54.470
Even when at home,
keep your phone around your neck.

00:28:54.537 --> 00:28:55.638
Jeez.

00:28:56.539 --> 00:28:57.774
Understood.

00:28:58.575 --> 00:29:01.144
So? What did that trainer say?
Whatever his name is.

00:29:02.312 --> 00:29:04.247
Mr. Hironaka.
I'm still waiting for his answer.

00:29:04.314 --> 00:29:07.851
You aren't thinking, "If it were just
Fight, this would have been decided"?

00:29:08.585 --> 00:29:10.386
You suggested this.

00:29:10.987 --> 00:29:12.589
Stand tall and own it.

00:29:13.556 --> 00:29:14.424
Yes.

00:29:15.058 --> 00:29:16.326
I apologize.

00:29:16.392 --> 00:29:18.161
We just need one win.

00:29:19.229 --> 00:29:20.830
One win with Fight.

00:29:20.897 --> 00:29:21.965
Yes.

00:29:22.031 --> 00:29:24.534
Horse racing is truly difficult, isn't it?

00:29:28.204 --> 00:29:30.139
See you.

00:29:31.941 --> 00:29:32.909
See you.

00:29:34.410 --> 00:29:36.579
Is it Mr. Shiina's horse?

00:29:41.217 --> 00:29:42.552
What's that horse?

00:29:43.887 --> 00:29:44.988
What?

00:29:48.291 --> 00:29:49.826
See you.

00:30:09.779 --> 00:30:11.214
Good morning.

00:30:12.048 --> 00:30:13.416
Oh, Mr. Kurisu.

00:30:13.483 --> 00:30:16.653
I apologize for taking so long.

00:30:17.220 --> 00:30:18.688
To get straight to the point,

00:30:18.755 --> 00:30:23.793
I will take on both
Royal Fight and Royal Izana.

00:30:23.860 --> 00:30:25.762
I look forward to working with you.

00:30:29.299 --> 00:30:30.233
What?

00:30:32.035 --> 00:30:33.603
Are you sure?

00:30:33.670 --> 00:30:36.139
I mean, you asked me to.

00:30:36.205 --> 00:30:37.974
That's true, but…

00:30:39.575 --> 00:30:41.311
Those two are better off together.

00:30:42.078 --> 00:30:43.713
Their lineage is interesting too.

00:30:44.314 --> 00:30:47.450
It's meetings like this
that make Hidaka horses fun.

00:30:47.517 --> 00:30:53.122
Of course, that's not the only reason,
but I think it's worth the challenge.

00:30:54.724 --> 00:30:56.526
Thank you.

00:30:56.592 --> 00:30:58.528
-Thank you so much.
-It's nothing.

00:30:58.594 --> 00:30:59.762
I'm so glad.

00:31:00.563 --> 00:31:01.864
-I'll call my boss.
-Wait.

00:31:01.931 --> 00:31:04.734
Before that, I have a proposition.

00:31:04.801 --> 00:31:05.635
What?

00:31:05.702 --> 00:31:06.836
This way, please.

00:31:08.304 --> 00:31:09.572
He's here.

00:31:10.840 --> 00:31:13.176
Well, our boss decided on them.

00:31:14.744 --> 00:31:17.080
It's my job now. I'll do it right.

00:31:17.146 --> 00:31:18.348
For the horses' sake.

00:31:28.624 --> 00:31:29.692
Mr. Hironaka.

00:31:30.526 --> 00:31:31.661
Hello.

00:31:32.228 --> 00:31:33.629
Nice to meet you.

00:31:34.697 --> 00:31:37.734
-Nice to meet you, sir. Let's get along.
-Wait, don't call me…

00:31:37.800 --> 00:31:39.802
Hey. What strength!

00:31:40.436 --> 00:31:41.504
Sorry.

00:31:41.571 --> 00:31:45.074
He's young too.
They must call you handsome a lot.

00:31:45.141 --> 00:31:46.409
No, not at all.

00:31:51.080 --> 00:31:53.383
President, please sit down first.

00:31:53.449 --> 00:31:54.350
Sure.

00:31:57.987 --> 00:31:59.022
To get right to it,

00:31:59.689 --> 00:32:02.425
Mr. Hironaka has an idea
about the race entries.

00:32:04.894 --> 00:32:07.063
-Don't be ridiculous!
-You can win this way!

00:32:07.130 --> 00:32:08.431
That strategy won't work.

00:32:08.498 --> 00:32:11.200
Let's hear him out first. Let him explain.

00:32:11.934 --> 00:32:14.871
Are you telling us
to throw away all our work up to now?

00:32:14.937 --> 00:32:16.172
Of course not.

00:32:16.239 --> 00:32:19.075
I can't force something
you don't agree with.

00:32:19.675 --> 00:32:22.211
But there isn't much time.

00:32:22.278 --> 00:32:23.246
Mr. Sanno.

00:32:23.846 --> 00:32:25.681
I really believe we can win with this.

00:32:25.748 --> 00:32:26.816
I don't like it.

00:32:26.883 --> 00:32:28.851
President!

00:32:32.522 --> 00:32:33.823
I apologize.

00:32:33.890 --> 00:32:36.959
No, I understand the owner's feelings.

00:32:37.693 --> 00:32:39.595
We both share the desire to win.

00:32:40.329 --> 00:32:42.732
Mr. Kurisu, the rest is up to you.

00:32:53.509 --> 00:32:55.178
Find someone else.

00:32:58.481 --> 00:33:00.450
Before Fight ran in Niigata

00:33:01.384 --> 00:33:05.621
I visited those two horses
at the Hayashida Ranch.

00:33:07.223 --> 00:33:08.591
What's the dam's name?

00:33:08.658 --> 00:33:10.493
It's Izana.

00:33:10.560 --> 00:33:11.727
What does it mean?

00:33:11.794 --> 00:33:13.629
A place in Spain.

00:33:13.696 --> 00:33:18.201
My son, who died nine years ago,
named her.

00:33:19.936 --> 00:33:21.871
"Royal Izana."

00:33:21.938 --> 00:33:24.707
Exactly nine characters. Not bad.

00:33:24.774 --> 00:33:26.342
Mr. President.

00:33:26.976 --> 00:33:29.445
Her and that colt for 30 million.

00:33:29.512 --> 00:33:31.581
If you agree to that price,
I'll take them right away.

00:33:31.647 --> 00:33:33.749
Izana's lineage…

00:33:35.418 --> 00:33:38.588
is the work your son started,
which I'll preserve.

00:33:42.859 --> 00:33:44.260
What's your point?

00:33:44.327 --> 00:33:46.496
I thought you were a compassionate person.

00:33:48.364 --> 00:33:49.832
Don't be ridiculous.

00:33:51.534 --> 00:33:53.302
Do you think I'm someone

00:33:53.369 --> 00:33:56.372
who buys a meaningless horse
just out of sentiment?

00:33:56.439 --> 00:33:59.475
-Then, you saw a chance at winning?
-I don't know.

00:34:14.223 --> 00:34:15.558
What's with that face?

00:34:19.095 --> 00:34:20.263
I told you.

00:34:21.531 --> 00:34:23.499
I don't know about horses.

00:34:24.600 --> 00:34:26.669
I buy them by trusting people.

00:34:29.172 --> 00:34:31.607
I simply bought them
by trusting Hayashida.

00:34:33.809 --> 00:34:34.710
Then…

00:34:36.245 --> 00:34:38.981
why don't you try trusting
Mr. Hironaka too?

00:34:43.152 --> 00:34:45.288
I also don't know about horses.

00:34:45.354 --> 00:34:49.325
And if you don't either,

00:34:50.059 --> 00:34:53.462
then shouldn't we trust the person
most familiar with horses?

00:34:54.030 --> 00:34:58.467
I want to trust Mr. Hironaka.

00:34:59.135 --> 00:35:02.505
After all,
he told us something no one else did.

00:35:02.572 --> 00:35:03.406
That we can win.

00:35:03.973 --> 00:35:05.474
What he's trying to do is a gamble.

00:35:05.541 --> 00:35:07.944
Then everything has been a gamble!

00:35:08.010 --> 00:35:10.112
My career change to manager.

00:35:10.813 --> 00:35:13.049
And you, President,
becoming a horse owner.

00:35:13.115 --> 00:35:14.517
It's all a gamble.

00:35:15.284 --> 00:35:18.721
In that case, I want to trust people.

00:35:21.324 --> 00:35:22.825
Make a bet.

00:35:23.659 --> 00:35:24.994
On me.

00:35:28.464 --> 00:35:33.135
Tell him to explain it in a way
I can understand.

00:35:34.370 --> 00:35:36.005
No need for complicated logic.

00:35:37.907 --> 00:35:40.443
Explain so I can understand.

00:35:40.509 --> 00:35:41.711
Tell him to do that!

00:35:42.712 --> 00:35:43.813
You're the manager here!

00:35:46.649 --> 00:35:47.550
I will.

00:36:00.429 --> 00:36:02.164
NOZAKI FARM

00:36:02.732 --> 00:36:03.899
Grandpa.

00:36:03.966 --> 00:36:04.800
See?

00:36:04.867 --> 00:36:06.702
I knew he was a strange person.

00:36:07.336 --> 00:36:09.171
Did your introduction turn out well?

00:36:09.238 --> 00:36:10.740
It was fine.

00:36:10.806 --> 00:36:12.908
My savior has finally appeared.

00:36:12.975 --> 00:36:14.343
Thank you so much.

00:36:14.877 --> 00:36:17.713
But isn't that plan a little too bold?

00:36:17.780 --> 00:36:20.316
I can see why the president was hesitant.

00:36:20.383 --> 00:36:23.653
Well, I don't know much about horses.

00:36:24.353 --> 00:36:29.325
But Mr. Hironaka
said he believes we can win.

00:36:32.628 --> 00:36:33.562
You must be happy.

00:36:34.196 --> 00:36:36.032
Yes, I am.

00:36:37.566 --> 00:36:41.370
I mean, when someone says
your horse can win,

00:36:42.138 --> 00:36:43.472
it makes you feel happy.

00:36:44.206 --> 00:36:45.074
So happy.

00:36:45.574 --> 00:36:49.145
And to top it off,
he's taking on both horses.

00:36:49.211 --> 00:36:51.681
No one else would do that.

00:36:54.884 --> 00:36:56.218
I'll watch the race.

00:36:56.986 --> 00:36:58.788
I have work, so I'll watch it on TV,

00:37:00.923 --> 00:37:02.491
but trust my jinx.

00:37:03.559 --> 00:37:04.593
Yes.

00:37:07.296 --> 00:37:08.664
I hope you win.

00:37:11.901 --> 00:37:13.002
Yes.

00:37:16.539 --> 00:37:18.541
This is Hironaka. Mr. Shiina.

00:37:19.675 --> 00:37:23.045
-I tried to fit them in but…
-That's a 230 million yen horse, you know.

00:37:24.814 --> 00:37:27.516
-Unfortunately, I just don't have…
-Hello, it's Shiina.

00:37:27.583 --> 00:37:29.452
Thank you for the other day.

00:37:29.518 --> 00:37:31.354
-I'm sorry.
-It's fine.

00:37:31.420 --> 00:37:33.556
-I mean it.
-Understood.

00:37:33.622 --> 00:37:36.525
We had no luck this time,
but I hope we'll have another chance.

00:37:36.592 --> 00:37:37.793
Yes.

00:37:38.294 --> 00:37:39.261
I apologize.

00:37:39.328 --> 00:37:40.329
Goodbye.

00:37:41.897 --> 00:37:44.900
He probably went with Royal Human.

00:37:50.106 --> 00:37:52.541
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

00:37:52.608 --> 00:37:54.977
This is an important time
leading up to the fall races.

00:37:55.044 --> 00:37:56.312
Yes.

00:37:56.379 --> 00:37:59.115
Fight and Izana,
the two new horses we've taken in,

00:37:59.181 --> 00:38:01.083
already have racing experience,

00:38:01.150 --> 00:38:03.819
but first, they need to get used
to our training and environment.

00:38:03.886 --> 00:38:06.055
For Fight, we need to handle
his eagerness…

00:38:06.122 --> 00:38:08.557
His relationship
with the jockey is crucial.

00:38:08.624 --> 00:38:09.558
Yes.

00:38:09.625 --> 00:38:11.961
ROYAL FIGHT - YASUKAWA

00:38:12.795 --> 00:38:14.330
Two uphill gallops.

00:38:14.397 --> 00:38:17.166
The first in 70, the second in 65.

00:38:17.233 --> 00:38:19.301
Then the gate.

00:38:20.369 --> 00:38:22.405
For Izana, don't hold her back too much,

00:38:22.471 --> 00:38:25.107
let her use her stride properly,
and improve her rhythm.

00:38:25.174 --> 00:38:28.344
Since they just arrived,
small changes are likely.

00:38:28.411 --> 00:38:29.545
Take good care of them.

00:38:29.612 --> 00:38:30.446
Yes!

00:38:30.513 --> 00:38:33.215
Let's divide the buckets by type.

00:38:33.282 --> 00:38:34.550
Uphill gallop today?

00:38:34.617 --> 00:38:37.486
No, I'll have them finish strong
on the wood chip course.

00:38:38.053 --> 00:38:39.789
Next is Royal Fight.

00:38:39.855 --> 00:38:42.591
Fight will proceed with the 1800m.

00:38:42.658 --> 00:38:43.859
Are things okay?

00:38:43.926 --> 00:38:44.960
Yes.

00:38:53.536 --> 00:38:56.505
He doesn't look like he's engaging
his hindquarters well today.

00:38:56.572 --> 00:38:59.275
-What's it like riding him?
-Oh, I agree.

00:38:59.842 --> 00:39:02.011
Okay. Let's decide tomorrow's schedule.

00:39:02.077 --> 00:39:05.047
The other day,
Fight had an issue with his hoof,

00:39:05.114 --> 00:39:10.186
and we had him fitted with special shoes,
but I need to discuss the cost for that.

00:39:10.252 --> 00:39:12.021
Understood.

00:39:12.588 --> 00:39:15.925
I'll check the itemized bill
and inform the president.

00:39:15.991 --> 00:39:17.193
-Mr. Tsuchiya!
-Yes?

00:39:17.259 --> 00:39:19.361
-Go ahead.
-Got it.

00:39:38.914 --> 00:39:42.084
-They dislike apples.
-I see. So that's why they don't eat them.

00:39:42.151 --> 00:39:43.853
I'm sorry, it's my fault.

00:39:44.720 --> 00:39:45.688
How's their gait?

00:39:46.288 --> 00:39:49.058
The same as before.

00:39:52.795 --> 00:39:54.230
Let's do one and a half legs tomorrow.

00:39:54.296 --> 00:39:56.065
Okay, I'll tell them.

00:39:56.131 --> 00:39:57.500
Oh, Yasukawa.

00:39:58.367 --> 00:40:00.703
-Have you seen my walkie-talkie?
-What?

00:40:01.237 --> 00:40:02.872
-It's Kurisu. Excuse me.
-Yes?

00:40:04.039 --> 00:40:06.175
Their participation in the race is set.

00:40:06.809 --> 00:40:09.178
This is Mr. Shiina's horse.

00:40:09.245 --> 00:40:10.679
Not again.

00:40:14.383 --> 00:40:15.985
Good morning, Fight!

00:40:17.253 --> 00:40:19.355
Trainers should abandon their egos.

00:40:19.421 --> 00:40:21.457
Everyone should let go of their egos

00:40:21.524 --> 00:40:23.993
and dedicate themselves
only to the horses.

00:40:24.059 --> 00:40:25.895
All right, let's start.

00:40:25.961 --> 00:40:27.129
Yes!

00:40:31.934 --> 00:40:34.537
-2,000 meters on turf?
-Yes.

00:40:34.603 --> 00:40:35.905
Turf?

00:40:35.971 --> 00:40:37.072
Yes.

00:40:40.175 --> 00:40:42.778
I will definitely go see it.

00:40:42.845 --> 00:40:44.213
Please do.

00:40:44.280 --> 00:40:45.180
Yes.

00:40:50.753 --> 00:40:52.454
It's from Mr. Hironaka.

00:40:53.122 --> 00:40:56.759
Nakayama, third week of September.
They will run as scheduled.

00:41:00.863 --> 00:41:03.699
It's completely different
from the Niigata race.

00:41:04.433 --> 00:41:05.367
What is?

00:41:06.001 --> 00:41:08.671
-My state of mind, waiting for the race.
-Here you go.

00:41:09.538 --> 00:41:12.575
How could you bear this feeling
so many times?

00:41:12.641 --> 00:41:14.343
Do you get used to it?

00:41:14.410 --> 00:41:15.945
Of course not.

00:41:16.011 --> 00:41:18.981
I'd give anything to have
someone take my place.

00:41:41.704 --> 00:41:43.539
A new start.

00:41:44.840 --> 00:41:46.475
Come on, let's go.

00:41:46.542 --> 00:41:47.743
-Yes.
-Yes.

00:41:49.378 --> 00:41:50.379
-Good luck.
-Thanks.

00:41:50.946 --> 00:41:52.414
-Good luck.
-Thanks.

00:42:15.037 --> 00:42:16.438
Hello.

00:42:16.505 --> 00:42:18.040
-Hello.
-Good luck.

00:42:23.112 --> 00:42:25.147
I wonder how they will fare.

00:42:25.781 --> 00:42:27.483
Oh, right.

00:42:29.251 --> 00:42:30.185
This.

00:42:32.421 --> 00:42:34.823
I feel kind of bad
receiving something so expensive.

00:42:35.658 --> 00:42:37.126
No need to thank me.

00:42:38.694 --> 00:42:43.265
However, it's too fancy for me,
I felt unworthy.

00:42:43.332 --> 00:42:45.567
I almost returned it immediately.

00:42:46.902 --> 00:42:48.637
But if we win today,

00:42:48.704 --> 00:42:52.841
this watch will be
an incredible good luck charm.

00:42:53.509 --> 00:42:56.812
So, from now on,
I intend to only use it for major races.

00:42:56.879 --> 00:42:58.647
Like a charm.

00:43:00.115 --> 00:43:01.283
What if we lose?

00:43:04.153 --> 00:43:06.188
If we lose, what will you do with it?

00:43:06.255 --> 00:43:07.690
President.

00:43:07.756 --> 00:43:10.826
Nobody thinks about losing
a race before it starts.

00:43:10.893 --> 00:43:11.927
So you'll sell it?

00:43:11.994 --> 00:43:12.828
I won't!

00:43:12.895 --> 00:43:14.163
You're going to sell it off!

00:43:14.229 --> 00:43:15.397
I won't.

00:43:15.464 --> 00:43:16.665
Hello!

00:43:17.933 --> 00:43:19.301
You're quite something, huh?

00:43:20.369 --> 00:43:22.004
You think you can win?

00:43:22.071 --> 00:43:23.472
I'm here. Can't you tell?

00:43:25.741 --> 00:43:29.144
This is why the race is only fun
with Royal around!

00:43:29.211 --> 00:43:31.013
That guy is noisy.

00:43:35.851 --> 00:43:37.753
-Do your best.
-I will.

00:43:45.527 --> 00:43:47.830
You can have your fun after
you've seen how this ends.

00:43:47.896 --> 00:43:51.233
The third day of the fourth Nakayama Race.
We're on the fourth race.

00:43:51.300 --> 00:43:54.603
The runners for the 3-year-old Maiden Race
will be entering shortly.

00:43:54.670 --> 00:43:56.171
Orne Regis.

00:43:56.238 --> 00:44:00.175
Despite being a maiden horse,
its current odds are 2.5.

00:44:00.242 --> 00:44:03.378
Pedigree, body, temperament,
it's flawless in every way.

00:44:03.445 --> 00:44:04.713
Truly a sure winner.

00:44:07.282 --> 00:44:10.219
The weather is good, it's a bright day.

00:44:10.285 --> 00:44:16.158
Now, I'll announce the horses'
as well as the dirt and turf conditions.

00:44:16.825 --> 00:44:19.361
-I'll make coffee.
-Number Four, Smart Imal.

00:44:19.428 --> 00:44:22.998
472 kilograms.
Plus two kilograms. Shintaro Ogi.

00:44:23.565 --> 00:44:24.399
I'm home!

00:44:24.466 --> 00:44:25.367
Welcome home.

00:44:25.434 --> 00:44:26.835
I'm starving.

00:44:26.902 --> 00:44:28.504
-It's starting.
-Okay.

00:44:28.570 --> 00:44:29.872
Tetsuya Mizue.

00:44:29.938 --> 00:44:31.740
-Oh, right.
-So cool.

00:44:31.807 --> 00:44:33.442
-462 kilograms.
-You can do it!

00:44:33.509 --> 00:44:36.011
No change. Toru Kaneshiro.

00:44:36.078 --> 00:44:38.180
Number Seven, Gold Aerial.

00:44:38.247 --> 00:44:42.518
476 kilograms.
Minus eight kilograms. Takashi Sugawara.

00:44:43.051 --> 00:44:44.720
Number Eight, Orne Regis.

00:44:44.787 --> 00:44:46.221
438 kilograms.

00:44:46.288 --> 00:44:48.290
-Odds at 2.5.
-Plus two kilograms.

00:44:48.357 --> 00:44:49.825
-A safe bet, huh?
-Shoichi Yamazoe.

00:44:51.193 --> 00:44:52.895
Number Nine, Sun Garbo.

00:44:52.961 --> 00:44:57.232
474 kilograms.
Minus four kilograms. Ryu Yasuda.

00:44:59.601 --> 00:45:00.435
Here they come.

00:45:03.372 --> 00:45:05.808
ROYAL IZANA

00:45:05.874 --> 00:45:08.076
Number Ten, Royal Izana.

00:45:08.143 --> 00:45:09.711
482 kilograms.

00:45:09.778 --> 00:45:11.146
-What? Why?
-Plus two kilograms.

00:45:11.213 --> 00:45:12.381
-Keita Tosaki.
-It's not Fight?

00:45:12.447 --> 00:45:15.050
-It's Izana!
-That's all ten horses.

00:45:15.617 --> 00:45:17.653
President, please sit down first.

00:45:18.520 --> 00:45:20.088
To get right to it,

00:45:20.155 --> 00:45:22.825
Mr. Hironaka has an idea
about the race entries.

00:45:22.891 --> 00:45:23.792
What?

00:45:24.426 --> 00:45:26.562
Royal Fight and Royal Izana

00:45:26.628 --> 00:45:29.631
both have races
in the third week of September.

00:45:29.698 --> 00:45:31.200
I'd like to switch them around.

00:45:31.266 --> 00:45:32.534
What?

00:45:32.601 --> 00:45:35.838
We're putting Izana,
who has always run on dirt,

00:45:35.904 --> 00:45:37.506
into a turf maiden race,

00:45:37.573 --> 00:45:41.310
and Fight, who has always
run on turf, into a dirt race.

00:45:41.376 --> 00:45:43.111
What are you talking about?

00:45:43.178 --> 00:45:46.882
Royal Izana,
since she debuted at Tadokoro Stables,

00:45:46.949 --> 00:45:48.717
has suffered many losses on turf,

00:45:48.784 --> 00:45:51.820
and for the past year,
she's raced exclusively on dirt,

00:45:51.887 --> 00:45:53.422
but without results.

00:45:53.488 --> 00:45:56.725
She hasn't been in a race for six months.

00:45:56.792 --> 00:46:00.662
Fight, on the other hand,
has never run on dirt.

00:46:00.729 --> 00:46:02.664
The 2,000 meters on turf, must be Fight!

00:46:02.731 --> 00:46:05.133
2,000 meters on turf is Fight's distance!

00:46:05.200 --> 00:46:06.168
Besides,

00:46:06.235 --> 00:46:09.271
what does Fight gain by running
in a race he has no experience in?

00:46:09.338 --> 00:46:11.373
Certainly, there is no benefit for Fight.

00:46:11.440 --> 00:46:13.775
-Don't be ridiculous!
-You can win this way!

00:46:13.842 --> 00:46:16.879
-That strategy won't work!
-Let's hear him out first.

00:46:16.945 --> 00:46:18.113
Let him explain.

00:46:18.180 --> 00:46:21.149
Are you telling us
to throw away all our work up to now?

00:46:22.017 --> 00:46:23.318
She can do it.

00:46:29.458 --> 00:46:31.727
It's Royal Izana.

00:46:45.974 --> 00:46:47.075
It's Izana!

00:46:47.142 --> 00:46:47.976
Mom!

00:46:49.645 --> 00:46:50.812
It's Izana!

00:46:56.251 --> 00:46:57.786
Interesting.

00:46:57.853 --> 00:46:59.054
You can do it!

00:47:20.842 --> 00:47:23.045
Izana!

00:47:23.845 --> 00:47:24.913
Izana!

00:47:24.980 --> 00:47:25.881
Do your best!

00:47:33.822 --> 00:47:40.028
THREE-YEAR-OLD MAIDEN RACE

00:47:40.095 --> 00:47:41.763
Nakayama Racecourse, fourth race.

00:47:41.830 --> 00:47:44.366
A 2000-meter turf maiden race
for three-year-olds.

00:47:45.600 --> 00:47:46.835
Her gait is good.

00:47:46.902 --> 00:47:48.370
Dead last in popularity, huh?

00:47:48.437 --> 00:47:51.673
-Don't underestimate her.
-It's a grandstand start for this race.

00:47:51.740 --> 00:47:54.543
-Izana is on the turf.
-The wind has picked up a little.

00:47:54.609 --> 00:47:57.379
Both the turf and dirt tracks
are in good condition.

00:47:57.446 --> 00:48:00.015
-Have fun!
-Kono Blade and Martani…

00:48:00.082 --> 00:48:04.152
Are both out due to injury,
making this a ten-horse race.

00:48:04.219 --> 00:48:05.988
Last is Number Ten, Royal Izana.

00:48:06.688 --> 00:48:08.857
She's hesitating before the gate.

00:48:08.924 --> 00:48:10.258
What's it going to be?

00:48:10.826 --> 00:48:12.327
-Royal Izana.
-It's okay.

00:48:12.394 --> 00:48:13.795
Izana, calm down.

00:48:13.862 --> 00:48:16.832
Led by the handlers,
she's now settled in the gate.

00:48:18.000 --> 00:48:21.470
This is a strategy to run Izana on turf.

00:48:21.536 --> 00:48:23.205
When I looked at the documents,

00:48:23.271 --> 00:48:25.540
a few generations back
in Izana's pedigree,

00:48:25.607 --> 00:48:27.909
there was a horse I know well.

00:48:27.976 --> 00:48:29.277
Mighty Plat.

00:48:29.344 --> 00:48:31.980
That horse was very strong
in the 2000-meter turf races.

00:48:32.514 --> 00:48:36.952
However, looking at Izana's race record,
it's all sprint races on dirt.

00:48:37.019 --> 00:48:39.488
They probably avoided
middle-distance races

00:48:39.554 --> 00:48:40.956
due to her crooked leg,

00:48:41.523 --> 00:48:43.158
but frankly,

00:48:43.225 --> 00:48:46.595
this is a terrible choice
that wastes Izana's strength.

00:48:47.396 --> 00:48:50.332
She should be allowed to run freely.

00:48:50.399 --> 00:48:51.433
Excuse me.

00:48:52.000 --> 00:48:55.237
Why put Fight into a dirt race
where he has no experience?

00:48:55.804 --> 00:48:58.407
Why not use both horses
in the same turf race?

00:48:59.107 --> 00:49:01.743
Have you ever heard
of preferential entry rights?

00:49:01.810 --> 00:49:04.546
At that time, in a maiden race,

00:49:04.613 --> 00:49:07.682
the main condition
for getting preferential entry

00:49:08.250 --> 00:49:12.654
was to have placed fifth or higher once
within the last four races.

00:49:12.721 --> 00:49:14.289
That's how it was.

00:49:14.356 --> 00:49:17.559
In other words,
if Fight is entered in that race,

00:49:17.626 --> 00:49:20.362
his preferential entry would be certain,

00:49:20.429 --> 00:49:23.565
and the maiden Izana may be excluded.

00:49:23.632 --> 00:49:25.200
That's right. So…

00:49:25.867 --> 00:49:27.803
We'll change Fight's entry

00:49:27.869 --> 00:49:30.505
to increase the chance
of Izana being able to run.

00:49:31.873 --> 00:49:33.608
She's a spirited yet sensitive.

00:49:33.675 --> 00:49:36.344
The type who prefers
expectation and attention

00:49:36.411 --> 00:49:37.946
over gentle care.

00:49:38.013 --> 00:49:40.382
That's my first impression of Izana.

00:49:40.449 --> 00:49:41.950
As for Fight…

00:49:42.017 --> 00:49:44.086
He's more hardy than carefree.

00:49:44.152 --> 00:49:47.556
Fight might be the type
who doesn't care where he's running.

00:49:48.090 --> 00:49:51.993
These are Yasukawa, our assistant trainer,
and Toyama, a veteran stable hand.

00:49:52.060 --> 00:49:53.028
I'm Kurisu.

00:49:53.095 --> 00:49:54.096
Nice to meet you.

00:49:54.162 --> 00:49:54.996
Likewise.

00:49:55.063 --> 00:49:57.232
These two will be in charge of the horses.

00:50:01.303 --> 00:50:02.604
Just to confirm,

00:50:02.671 --> 00:50:08.243
you are so determined
to run Izana on turf because…

00:50:09.711 --> 00:50:14.516
I believe Izana
has a higher chance of winning than Fight.

00:50:15.817 --> 00:50:19.287
All the horses are in the gate.
The gate attendant is moving away.

00:50:22.624 --> 00:50:24.693
The red light is on, and they are off!

00:50:26.128 --> 00:50:28.830
A somewhat messy start for the ten horses.

00:50:29.397 --> 00:50:31.466
First, Number Ten with the pink helmet.

00:50:31.533 --> 00:50:34.469
-Yes.
-Royal Izana got a good outside start.

00:50:34.536 --> 00:50:36.238
No way! Leading from the start?

00:50:36.304 --> 00:50:37.205
-She's in the lead!
-What?

00:50:37.272 --> 00:50:38.206
Oh, she's first!

00:50:38.273 --> 00:50:39.207
-Royal Izana!
-Amazing.

00:50:39.274 --> 00:50:41.343
Number One,
Nagano Finite moves up into second!

00:50:41.409 --> 00:50:42.277
Hey.

00:50:42.344 --> 00:50:47.048
Izana's ancestor, Mighty Plat,
was a famous front-runner.

00:50:47.115 --> 00:50:48.850
The other horses don't matter!

00:50:50.085 --> 00:50:53.054
Yes, Izana, run!

00:50:53.121 --> 00:50:55.557
-Royal Izana is in the lead!
-Run!

00:50:58.693 --> 00:51:00.495
The lead is widening
from one horse to two!

00:51:00.562 --> 00:51:04.466
Number Two, Honolulu Even,
has smoothly moved into second place.

00:51:04.533 --> 00:51:06.768
From the inside, Number One,
Nagano Finite,

00:51:06.835 --> 00:51:09.271
and in fourth place
is Number Eight, Orne Regis.

00:51:09.337 --> 00:51:12.107
Then one length back
is Number Three, Togen Marilyn.

00:51:12.174 --> 00:51:13.842
-On the outside is Gold Aerial.
-Go!

00:51:14.442 --> 00:51:17.045
They're midway down the backstretch,
the lead is about one length.

00:51:17.112 --> 00:51:19.247
Number Six, Karasos,
is running third from last.

00:51:19.314 --> 00:51:21.883
Two lengths back,
on the inside is Number Four, Smart Imal.

00:51:21.950 --> 00:51:24.319
One length further outside
is Number Five, Pangoose.

00:51:24.386 --> 00:51:26.454
They passed the 1,000-meter mark
in 58 seconds.

00:51:26.521 --> 00:51:28.523
-That's fast.
-It's a quick pace!

00:51:28.590 --> 00:51:31.693
The horses are now heading
from the backstretch to the third corner.

00:51:31.760 --> 00:51:36.431
The leader is Number Ten, Royal Izana,
six to seven lengths ahead of the rest.

00:51:36.498 --> 00:51:39.434
Number Ten, Royal Izana,
heads into the third corner.

00:51:39.501 --> 00:51:42.571
Six to seven lengths ahead of the rest,
she's built up a good lead.

00:51:42.637 --> 00:51:43.572
She can do it.

00:51:43.638 --> 00:51:46.441
Into the third corner,
with a significant lead!

00:51:46.508 --> 00:51:48.677
Royal Izana is in the lead,
with the pink helmet.

00:51:48.743 --> 00:51:51.980
And Number Eight, Orne Regis,
in the orange helmet…

00:51:52.047 --> 00:51:53.048
Here they come.

00:51:53.114 --> 00:51:55.517
-All right!
-The favorite, Orne Regis.

00:51:55.584 --> 00:51:57.519
Is Yamazoe making his move here,

00:51:57.586 --> 00:51:59.988
gaining ground
in the middle of the third corner?

00:52:00.055 --> 00:52:03.358
The leader is Number Ten, Royal Izana.
The gap is closing slightly.

00:52:03.425 --> 00:52:05.026
The pink helmet, Royal Izana.

00:52:05.093 --> 00:52:06.061
Go!

00:52:06.127 --> 00:52:07.996
-The final turn…
-Run!

00:52:08.063 --> 00:52:10.098
Heading towards Nakayama's final slope.

00:52:10.165 --> 00:52:11.733
-The leader is Number Ten.
-Run!

00:52:11.800 --> 00:52:12.701
Run!

00:52:12.767 --> 00:52:14.936
-Orne Regis is closing the gap.
-Run!

00:52:15.003 --> 00:52:16.705
Run, Izana!

00:52:16.771 --> 00:52:18.173
Run!

00:52:18.240 --> 00:52:20.875
Number Eight, Orne Regis,
has now moved up to second place.

00:52:20.942 --> 00:52:23.144
-Passing the 400-meter mark.
-Hang in there!

00:52:23.211 --> 00:52:25.513
-The fourth corner! The final turn!
-Make your move!

00:52:25.580 --> 00:52:28.283
Heading towards Nakayama's final slope.

00:53:00.715 --> 00:53:02.550
They've passed the 200-meter marker.

00:53:02.617 --> 00:53:05.287
-Keep it up!
-Go!

00:53:05.353 --> 00:53:07.222
Will they live up to expectations?

00:53:07.289 --> 00:53:08.490
-Catch her…
-Orne Regis!

00:53:08.556 --> 00:53:09.724
Will they meet expectations?

00:53:09.791 --> 00:53:11.393
-Royal Izana in the lead.
-Catch her!

00:53:11.459 --> 00:53:12.894
-Two lengths. One length.
-Catch her!

00:53:12.961 --> 00:53:14.629
Half a length. The lead has shrunk!

00:53:14.696 --> 00:53:16.765
-The favorite, Number Eight, Orne Regis!
-Do it.

00:53:16.831 --> 00:53:18.767
-Izana!
-Do it!

00:53:18.833 --> 00:53:20.702
-Catch her!
-They're side by side!

00:53:20.769 --> 00:53:22.904
Will it be Royal Izana or the favorite?

00:53:22.971 --> 00:53:25.073
They're side by side!

00:53:25.140 --> 00:53:26.675
An incredible final dash!

00:53:26.741 --> 00:53:29.277
Orne Regis is going all out!

00:53:29.344 --> 00:53:30.278
Go!

00:53:30.345 --> 00:53:32.714
-Go!
-Smart Imal is coming up from the outside.

00:53:32.781 --> 00:53:34.349
Honolulu Even from the inside!

00:53:34.416 --> 00:53:35.917
-Is it Royal Izana?
-Go!

00:53:35.984 --> 00:53:37.519
Or Orne Regis?

00:53:37.585 --> 00:53:39.754
-Go!
-Will Orne Regis make it in time?

00:53:39.821 --> 00:53:42.724
Two horses in the lead!

00:53:42.791 --> 00:53:47.696
Royal Izana showing her strength
at the end! Passes the finish line!

00:53:47.762 --> 00:53:49.097
-Amazing!
-Yes!

00:53:49.164 --> 00:53:51.266
Izana!

00:53:55.804 --> 00:53:59.841
She won! She actually won!

00:54:15.256 --> 00:54:17.258
-She won!
-Number Ten, Royal Izana!

00:54:17.325 --> 00:54:19.861
-She won!
-The favorite failed to meet expectations!

00:54:21.396 --> 00:54:23.965
A 111 to 1 payout!

00:54:24.032 --> 00:54:28.536
ROYAL IZANA

00:54:32.874 --> 00:54:33.875
President.

00:54:34.476 --> 00:54:35.543
We did it.

00:54:36.077 --> 00:54:38.680
-We did it, President!
-Idiot!

00:54:39.180 --> 00:54:41.683
It's just one win, at the lowest type,
a maiden race!

00:54:41.750 --> 00:54:44.018
We're aiming to win a G1!

00:54:52.827 --> 00:54:54.462
Take care of your charm.

00:54:56.464 --> 00:54:57.432
Yes.

00:55:10.245 --> 00:55:12.080
-Thank you.
-Thanks.

00:55:12.147 --> 00:55:14.315
You really hung in there, you know.

00:55:14.382 --> 00:55:15.617
-You did great.
-Thanks.

00:55:15.683 --> 00:55:17.051
You did great, truly.

00:55:17.118 --> 00:55:18.820
You gave it all you got.

00:55:19.621 --> 00:55:21.156
He knows it too!

00:55:26.027 --> 00:55:27.829
Yes!

00:55:27.896 --> 00:55:30.031
Izana won!

00:55:30.098 --> 00:55:32.534
Fight, she did it!

00:55:34.702 --> 00:55:37.172
That's right. Next is Fight's turn.

00:55:37.238 --> 00:55:38.973
You're definitely going to win!

00:55:43.711 --> 00:55:45.413
We won! Oh, wow! How much?

00:55:45.480 --> 00:55:47.415
-I don't know.
-You don't?

00:55:47.482 --> 00:55:50.418
Mom!

00:55:50.952 --> 00:55:52.120
Mom!

00:55:53.988 --> 00:55:57.892
The ancestor horse, Mighty Plat,
is a horse from my family's ranch.

00:55:57.959 --> 00:56:00.562
I see!

00:56:00.628 --> 00:56:03.064
That one probably earned the most for us.

00:56:03.765 --> 00:56:04.999
Sorry for not telling you.

00:56:05.066 --> 00:56:08.069
No one would have noticed that connection!

00:56:08.803 --> 00:56:12.140
Hey, tabloid trash, pay for the drinks
in exchange for the story!

00:56:12.674 --> 00:56:14.676
-Thank you!
-Seriously…

00:56:15.477 --> 00:56:19.180
So my intuition told me
that kind of race would be her strength.

00:56:19.781 --> 00:56:23.751
But if I said it, it would sound
like me favoring my family.

00:56:23.818 --> 00:56:25.453
Seriously.

00:56:26.087 --> 00:56:30.225
That's why I don't trust you.
Hiroshi from the Hironaka family.

00:56:31.326 --> 00:56:34.762
No, even if you can't trust me,

00:56:34.829 --> 00:56:38.566
please trust in the legacy of the horses.

00:56:38.633 --> 00:56:44.038
If Mighty Plat hadn't existed,
I might not have become a trainer,

00:56:44.105 --> 00:56:48.343
and if Fight and Izana weren't here,
that bloodline might have been lost.

00:56:51.012 --> 00:56:52.247
Thank you.

00:56:52.313 --> 00:56:54.382
No, it was all of us.

00:56:54.449 --> 00:56:56.951
-We won thanks to everyone's efforts.
-I mean…

00:56:57.018 --> 00:57:00.021
With this, Izana can run again next time.

00:57:00.088 --> 00:57:01.189
Fight too.

00:57:01.256 --> 00:57:03.525
The Horse Racing Division
can also continue.

00:57:04.092 --> 00:57:05.326
Thank you.

00:57:05.393 --> 00:57:06.528
Thank you so much.

00:57:06.594 --> 00:57:07.495
No…

00:57:08.463 --> 00:57:09.430
You're a great team.

00:57:09.497 --> 00:57:11.833
A team? We're nothing so fancy.

00:57:11.900 --> 00:57:13.001
Come on.

00:57:13.701 --> 00:57:15.169
Oh, thank you.

00:57:16.037 --> 00:57:17.071
Huh?

00:57:18.573 --> 00:57:20.642
I forgot my phone.

00:57:20.708 --> 00:57:21.976
Again?

00:57:22.043 --> 00:57:23.311
Oh, it's at Nakayama.

00:57:23.378 --> 00:57:25.113
-Let's call it.
-Hey.

00:57:25.179 --> 00:57:26.781
Let's have a toast.

00:57:26.848 --> 00:57:29.584
-A toast!
-A toast? How many toasts have we done?

00:57:29.651 --> 00:57:30.485
Are you okay?

00:57:32.587 --> 00:57:34.656
-Welcome home.
-I'm home.

00:57:35.757 --> 00:57:37.659
There was a call from the new secretary.

00:57:38.226 --> 00:57:41.796
He wants to keep working
in the Horse Racing Division.

00:57:43.364 --> 00:57:47.302
Father's rotten luck is unbelievable.

00:57:53.608 --> 00:57:56.611
My dream is to win the Arima Kinen.

00:57:57.111 --> 00:57:58.212
The Arima?

00:57:59.247 --> 00:58:01.449
You thought, "Why not the Japan Derby?"

00:58:02.650 --> 00:58:06.421
The Derby and other races
are where strong horses compete,

00:58:07.088 --> 00:58:08.856
but the Arima is different.

00:58:10.725 --> 00:58:12.894
You're not chosen just for being strong.

00:58:12.961 --> 00:58:17.332
Only horses loved by fans and whose
running is recognized are chosen.

00:58:17.398 --> 00:58:20.535
And from among those,
the winner is decided.

00:58:22.470 --> 00:58:23.771
There's emotion.

00:58:23.838 --> 00:58:24.939
There's love.

00:58:25.940 --> 00:58:27.542
Plus, it's a year-end festival,

00:58:28.042 --> 00:58:31.012
where all the memories
of that years losses are blown away.

00:58:31.079 --> 00:58:33.548
-No, come on.
-You can win it all.

00:58:33.615 --> 00:58:34.849
It's the best.

00:58:35.917 --> 00:58:38.152
We will win the Arima Kinen.

00:58:38.219 --> 00:58:40.421
Absolutely. Cheers!

00:58:40.488 --> 00:58:41.856
Cheers!

00:58:41.923 --> 00:58:48.930
SANNO AND HIRONAKA
THE ROYAL FAMILY BEGINS

00:58:49.831 --> 00:58:51.633
-Our next challenge.
-The auction?

00:58:51.699 --> 00:58:52.433
We must get a horse.

00:58:52.500 --> 00:58:55.970
-We're looking for a new horse.
-People's livelihoods are at stake!

00:58:56.037 --> 00:58:57.572
We can't sell to someone
who doesn't intend to win!

00:58:57.639 --> 00:58:59.207
-Dad, please!
-I said we won't sell!

00:58:59.273 --> 00:59:01.809
We are making this deal to win.

00:59:01.876 --> 00:59:04.979
My father's dream
is the dream of everyone in Hidaka.

00:59:05.046 --> 00:59:05.980
