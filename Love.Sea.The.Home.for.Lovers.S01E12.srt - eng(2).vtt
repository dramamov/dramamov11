00:00:01.085 --> 00:00:02.675
My life

00:00:02.925 --> 00:00:04.335
has always been supported those
who create souls of books and movies

00:00:04.725 --> 00:00:07.685
the very people I admire.

00:00:09.375 --> 00:00:10.885
But I never thought

00:00:11.625 --> 00:00:14.065
someone I admire would ever step into my life.

00:00:14.965 --> 00:00:16.965
No working on vacation!

00:00:17.865 --> 00:00:19.805
But work just found me.

00:00:23.125 --> 00:00:24.365
We're supposed to be together

00:00:24.685 --> 00:00:25.885
but you're not interested in me?

00:00:28.675 --> 00:00:29.965
Of course I'm interested.

00:00:30.195 --> 00:00:31.395
That's why I came here with you.

00:00:36.435 --> 00:00:38.385
Then we should be looking at each other, like this.

00:00:39.635 --> 00:00:40.635
Right?

00:00:47.195 --> 00:00:48.195
Huh?

00:00:49.565 --> 00:00:51.095
Wait, please don't.

00:00:52.305 --> 00:00:53.305
Don't cover up. Let me see your face.

00:00:53.585 --> 00:00:54.985
- No.
- Why not?

00:00:55.635 --> 00:00:57.725
I should be the one taking pictures of you.

00:00:58.035 --> 00:00:59.035
No way.

00:00:59.825 --> 00:01:00.825
Why not?

00:01:01.195 --> 00:01:02.195
You're so cute.

00:01:05.075 --> 00:01:06.075
No...

00:01:06.075 --> 00:01:07.715
Let me take it.

00:01:13.335 --> 00:01:14.535
Himeka-san, you're so cute...

00:01:45.955 --> 00:01:47.155
Do you have fun?

00:01:48.775 --> 00:01:50.315
It is a lot of fun.

00:02:01.825 --> 00:02:02.825
Falling for me all over again?

00:02:04.885 --> 00:02:05.885
Well...

00:02:06.195 --> 00:02:07.195
Hmm?

00:02:09.445 --> 00:02:10.985
I think I'll go for a walk.

00:02:11.875 --> 00:02:12.875
Trying to run away?

00:02:13.435 --> 00:02:15.835
They say when you come to the beach,
you have to play in the water.

00:02:16.705 --> 00:02:17.535
What?

00:02:17.535 --> 00:02:18.385
Who says so?

00:02:19.045 --> 00:02:20.365
Your boss.

00:02:26.605 --> 00:02:28.305
I'm going to get all wet!

00:02:28.635 --> 00:02:30.895
Of course. I'm splashing you.

00:02:42.495 --> 00:02:43.495
Come on!

00:02:44.305 --> 00:02:45.595
Ready to surrender?

00:02:46.515 --> 00:02:47.515
I give up!

00:03:05.605 --> 00:03:06.805
For now.

00:03:07.305 --> 00:03:08.905
The trip isn't over yet.

00:03:09.605 --> 00:03:10.805
Don't you forget it.

00:03:25.735 --> 00:03:26.735
Your shirt's open.

00:03:29.265 --> 00:03:30.265
You're back.

00:03:30.925 --> 00:03:31.925
Are you tired?

00:03:33.375 --> 00:03:34.735
You're so adorable.

00:03:42.815 --> 00:03:44.015
Button up your shirt.

00:03:44.475 --> 00:03:45.695
It's too hot. I don't want to.

00:03:46.295 --> 00:03:47.695
It's your skin's worst enemy.

00:03:51.815 --> 00:03:52.815
What are you doing?

00:03:52.845 --> 00:03:54.055
I'm wiping your sweat.

00:03:54.745 --> 00:03:56.065
Is this some custom from your hometown?

00:03:56.505 --> 00:03:57.505
It is.

00:03:57.745 --> 00:03:58.945
You should get used to it.

00:03:59.505 --> 00:04:01.855
My home is your home now.

00:04:03.955 --> 00:04:05.335
And you become this pervert.

00:04:06.285 --> 00:04:09.355
You're the pervert for liking to bite me.

00:04:10.475 --> 00:04:11.735
I'm nothing compared to you.

00:04:12.515 --> 00:04:14.235
Ow.

00:04:14.785 --> 00:04:15.785
Ouch.

00:04:16.055 --> 00:04:17.745
In front of such a possessive dog

00:04:17.745 --> 00:04:18.565
dressing like that...

00:04:19.075 --> 00:04:20.275
I'm not going to just let this go.

00:04:23.665 --> 00:04:24.875
Tonight

00:04:26.305 --> 00:04:27.805
we're having dinner with Fumi.

00:04:28.995 --> 00:04:30.195
Let's hurry up and eat

00:04:30.555 --> 00:04:32.905
I'm confident I can sweep you off you feet.

00:04:33.795 --> 00:04:34.795
Or...

00:04:35.115 --> 00:04:36.415
should we have a little warm-up before dinner?

00:04:40.735 --> 00:04:42.015
Deal!

00:04:42.875 --> 00:04:43.875
Teacher.

00:04:44.635 --> 00:04:47.445
Teacher Ai, I've been looking all over for you.

00:04:48.295 --> 00:04:50.365
Don't tell me you two are having dinner
alone again tonight.

00:04:50.495 --> 00:04:51.915
No way.

00:04:53.115 --> 00:04:54.115
Right?

00:04:54.805 --> 00:04:55.805
Right?

00:04:59.465 --> 00:05:00.465
Huh?

00:05:35.305 --> 00:05:41.805
"Love Sea The Home for Lovers"
(Special Episode 2)

00:05:42.635 --> 00:05:44.135
Cheers!

00:05:54.095 --> 00:05:56.115
Aren't you busy tonight?

00:05:57.645 --> 00:05:58.735
Ask Fumi.

00:06:09.405 --> 00:06:11.475
We're on a trip together.

00:06:11.835 --> 00:06:13.505
We should at least have one meal together.

00:06:14.125 --> 00:06:16.045
This is supposed to be a trip
for just the two of us.

00:06:16.405 --> 00:06:17.405
You two just go home.

00:06:18.575 --> 00:06:19.575
Oh.

00:06:21.305 --> 00:06:23.115
We've barely seen the owner of the house

00:06:23.425 --> 00:06:25.465
I feel bad for imposing on them

00:06:25.825 --> 00:06:26.825
I see.

00:06:27.115 --> 00:06:29.395
So we're not the only ones being disturbed?

00:06:29.665 --> 00:06:30.665
I forgive you.

00:06:31.645 --> 00:06:33.725
What temptation is Fumi-san running from?

00:06:34.645 --> 00:06:35.845
What could it be?

00:06:36.355 --> 00:06:37.355
What do you think, Ai?

00:06:38.405 --> 00:06:40.065
You two can do whatever you want after dinner.

00:06:40.635 --> 00:06:42.035
Teacher!

00:06:42.485 --> 00:06:44.105
We won't get in your way.

00:06:44.435 --> 00:06:45.435
Alright, alright.

00:06:46.685 --> 00:06:49.265
If there's anywhere you two want to go,
just let me know

00:06:49.265 --> 00:06:50.635
I'll have my brother take you.

00:06:50.905 --> 00:06:54.785
No need. It'd be a waste to have him
help us during the peak season.

00:06:55.035 --> 00:06:56.035
Business must be good, right?

00:06:56.605 --> 00:06:57.795
It's not bad.

00:06:58.405 --> 00:06:59.405
Right?

00:06:59.755 --> 00:07:00.755
Hey.

00:07:01.045 --> 00:07:02.045
Peel this shrimp for me.

00:07:02.565 --> 00:07:03.565
Okay.

00:07:06.365 --> 00:07:08.055
During the peak season,
for about five or six months.

00:07:08.605 --> 00:07:09.805
I stay on the island, too.

00:07:10.985 --> 00:07:12.135
My job can be done from anywhere.

00:07:12.505 --> 00:07:14.015
Luckily, life is flexible.

00:07:15.015 --> 00:07:16.015
That's true.

00:07:16.095 --> 00:07:18.885
When I first heard you were going to live
on the island, I was scared to death.

00:07:19.085 --> 00:07:21.005
It's a good thing you go back and forth.

00:07:21.565 --> 00:07:23.765
Ai is my only friend.

00:07:24.175 --> 00:07:27.185
- Is Ai-san all you need?
- That's right.

00:07:27.895 --> 00:07:28.895
Yes.

00:07:29.145 --> 00:07:30.145
If you want more

00:07:30.585 --> 00:07:31.585
I'll peel them.

00:07:32.095 --> 00:07:33.845
No, it's fine. You should have some, too.

00:07:35.595 --> 00:07:36.595
Um...

00:07:37.125 --> 00:07:38.405
I have a question.

00:07:39.405 --> 00:07:41.235
Have you two ever been angry with each other?

00:07:41.535 --> 00:07:43.535
- Ai-san gets angry all the time.
- Hey!

00:07:46.625 --> 00:07:48.105
What about... Kaishin-san?

00:07:48.765 --> 00:07:51.195
He's always so naturally caring.

00:07:51.515 --> 00:07:52.515
Like this.

00:07:54.635 --> 00:07:56.375
But he has been angry before.

00:07:57.025 --> 00:07:58.435
The one time he got really mad.

00:08:14.065 --> 00:08:15.065
Alone?

00:08:17.845 --> 00:08:18.845
Cheers.

00:08:18.975 --> 00:08:19.975
Cheers.

00:08:38.765 --> 00:08:39.765
He's...

00:08:55.595 --> 00:08:56.875
Nothing happened between us.

00:08:57.075 --> 00:08:58.075
Really.

00:08:58.075 --> 00:08:59.475
Then why were you so close?

00:08:59.525 --> 00:09:00.525
It wasn't me.

00:09:00.555 --> 00:09:01.555
He was the one who got close.

00:09:02.755 --> 00:09:03.755
I...

00:09:04.555 --> 00:09:06.175
Your brother asked me

00:09:06.555 --> 00:09:07.755
out for a drink.

00:09:08.155 --> 00:09:09.385
I called you, too

00:09:10.305 --> 00:09:11.505
I've done nothing.

00:09:13.875 --> 00:09:15.075
Don't be mad.

00:09:18.125 --> 00:09:19.645
He held your hand.

00:09:20.605 --> 00:09:21.705
I pulled it away.

00:09:24.185 --> 00:09:25.285
Where else did he touch you?

00:09:27.475 --> 00:09:29.605
My waist.

00:09:34.325 --> 00:09:35.325
Where else?

00:09:37.605 --> 00:09:38.605
My leg.

00:09:39.695 --> 00:09:41.295
- Take off your pants.
- What?

00:09:41.375 --> 00:09:42.365
Take them off.

00:10:08.395 --> 00:10:09.455
And?

00:10:11.015 --> 00:10:12.015
That's...

00:10:13.245 --> 00:10:14.245
all...

00:10:15.545 --> 00:10:16.745
You know

00:10:17.745 --> 00:10:19.045
that when I get mad,
I stay mad for a long time.

00:10:20.435 --> 00:10:21.635
So what should I do?

00:10:24.645 --> 00:10:25.925
Figure it out yourself.

00:10:58.205 --> 00:11:01.275
I don't want to imagine
the end of that story.

00:11:03.905 --> 00:11:05.105
What happened next?

00:11:06.195 --> 00:11:07.585
I'm not going to tell you for free.

00:11:08.865 --> 00:11:11.555
I want to know the ending.

00:11:12.925 --> 00:11:14.125
What happened next?

00:11:15.245 --> 00:11:16.585
Look at Ai's eyes.

00:11:18.445 --> 00:11:20.145
You can tell just by looking at him.

00:11:21.475 --> 00:11:23.105
He likes it when Kaishin is angry.

00:11:24.505 --> 00:11:25.815
What are you, a fortune teller?

00:11:26.915 --> 00:11:28.115
I see it.

00:11:28.435 --> 00:11:30.355
If that's the case, you're better hurry back.

00:11:31.185 --> 00:11:32.805
Don't mind if we do.

00:11:33.325 --> 00:11:34.325
Huh?

00:11:37.605 --> 00:11:38.605
Where are you going?

00:11:38.955 --> 00:11:40.685
Take your time, Fumi-san.

00:11:40.745 --> 00:11:42.295
We'll see you after tomorrow.

00:11:42.655 --> 00:11:43.855
Let's go.

00:11:44.625 --> 00:11:45.625
Bye-bye.

00:11:45.805 --> 00:11:46.805
Bye-bye.

00:11:52.525 --> 00:11:53.845
Bye-bye?

00:11:58.015 --> 00:12:00.765
I love it when Fumi is clueless.

00:12:01.085 --> 00:12:03.215
Just like how Ai loves an angry Kaishin.

00:12:07.255 --> 00:12:09.275
Let's finish this up, and then we'll go back, too.

00:12:15.905 --> 00:12:17.105
I can't hold back anymore.

00:12:17.925 --> 00:12:19.645
Why are you looking at me like that?

00:12:20.875 --> 00:12:22.295
I like seeing Kaishin angry...

00:12:30.725 --> 00:12:32.565
You were trembling that day...

00:12:36.565 --> 00:12:38.075
That's why I love it so much.

00:12:42.555 --> 00:12:43.755
I trust you.

00:12:45.225 --> 00:12:47.385
You like turning things into stories for me, don't you?

00:12:49.375 --> 00:12:50.925
I don't want to make you mad.

00:12:51.525 --> 00:12:52.325
But...

00:12:58.305 --> 00:12:59.305
But...

00:13:00.975 --> 00:13:02.655
I want something even more intense.

00:13:23.455 --> 00:13:28.935
- Do you know why Kaishin got angry at Ai?
- Hmm?

00:13:29.475 --> 00:13:30.475
Hmm?

00:13:35.215 --> 00:13:36.415
You still don't get it?

00:13:40.255 --> 00:13:43.475
I don't want to know how my boss's bedroom scene ends.

00:13:49.905 --> 00:13:51.675
If you keep drinking, Fumi,

00:13:52.145 --> 00:13:53.665
I might do something to you.

00:13:58.815 --> 00:14:00.375
Is that why you got me drunk?

00:14:04.635 --> 00:14:07.385
You drink because you know
what's happening, don't you?

00:14:11.455 --> 00:14:12.455
Yeah.

00:14:14.255 --> 00:14:15.455
I want to get drunk...

00:17:54.065 --> 00:17:55.345
Wait, hold on.

00:17:55.425 --> 00:17:56.625
Where are you touching me?

00:17:58.235 --> 00:18:00.275
Because you're so cute, Himeka-san.

00:18:01.695 --> 00:18:04.255
But we're not official.

00:18:05.605 --> 00:18:07.635
You're still hung up on that?

00:18:16.415 --> 00:18:17.415
I...

00:18:18.005 --> 00:18:19.005
I like you, Himeka-san.

00:18:19.005 --> 00:18:20.005
Hold on.

00:18:20.435 --> 00:18:23.075
So we'd only be dating to get into bed?

00:18:24.275 --> 00:18:25.565
Fumi, don't tell me you're...

00:18:26.195 --> 00:18:27.395
just after my body?

00:18:27.995 --> 00:18:28.995
That's not it.

00:18:31.155 --> 00:18:32.155
Sex...

00:18:32.515 --> 00:18:33.515
Hmm?

00:18:36.405 --> 00:18:38.365
I know this sounds foolish.

00:18:39.805 --> 00:18:40.805
But...

00:18:41.815 --> 00:18:43.015
Can I make your heart

00:18:43.135 --> 00:18:44.985
and your body

00:18:46.415 --> 00:18:48.355
as my entire reason for living?

00:19:03.285 --> 00:19:05.295
I just wanted to see that look on your face.

00:19:30.305 --> 00:19:32.395
Stealing my clothes again?

00:19:33.245 --> 00:19:34.445
Because it's comfortable.

00:19:35.185 --> 00:19:36.385
What about Ai-san's cheap stuff?

00:19:37.455 --> 00:19:39.765
It's custom-made silk pajamas.

00:19:40.175 --> 00:19:41.375
Why aren't you wearing it?

00:19:46.405 --> 00:19:47.655
I just want to wear this one.

00:19:52.995 --> 00:19:55.315
So this is the 'boyfriend shirt' feeling.

00:19:59.015 --> 00:20:00.015
Kaishin...

00:20:02.005 --> 00:20:04.455
you've given me so many firsts.

00:20:06.005 --> 00:20:07.675
Stargazing at the beach.

00:20:09.185 --> 00:20:10.595
Swimming in the ocean at night.

00:20:12.595 --> 00:20:14.185
Riding on the back of your motorcycle.

00:20:14.335 --> 00:20:15.535
Racing across the island.

00:20:17.185 --> 00:20:19.145
Making love on the beach... that was a first, too.

00:20:20.145 --> 00:20:21.145
Mmm.

00:20:21.655 --> 00:20:22.655
And...

00:20:26.145 --> 00:20:27.895
this amazing gift.

00:20:30.665 --> 00:20:31.865
Up until now,

00:20:32.955 --> 00:20:35.335
I've certainly received a lot of gifts.

00:20:36.415 --> 00:20:37.485
Designer brands

00:20:37.765 --> 00:20:38.955
fine wine, and watches...

00:20:40.925 --> 00:20:42.945
But nothing has ever been as special as this.

00:20:46.145 --> 00:20:47.975
Because you made it for me yourself, Kaishin.

00:20:48.625 --> 00:20:49.855
So I want to give you a gift in return.

00:20:50.945 --> 00:20:52.305
That's another first for me

00:20:54.025 --> 00:20:55.745
I've had a lot of firsts, too.

00:20:57.395 --> 00:20:58.985
My first time eloping.

00:20:59.855 --> 00:21:01.205
My first time being a dad.

00:21:02.255 --> 00:21:03.765
Dressing up formally.

00:21:04.175 --> 00:21:05.175
Ah.

00:21:05.825 --> 00:21:07.145
Though I don't do it often.

00:21:08.605 --> 00:21:10.655
There's still a plenty of things I want to do.

00:21:11.355 --> 00:21:12.355
Like...

00:21:13.975 --> 00:21:15.725
climbing a mountain for the first time.

00:21:16.235 --> 00:21:17.235
Let's go together.

00:21:18.295 --> 00:21:19.705
We'd have to sleep in a tent, you know.

00:21:20.785 --> 00:21:21.885
Does it have AC?

00:21:22.105 --> 00:21:23.105
Huh?

00:21:23.145 --> 00:21:24.475
That would spoil the mood.

00:21:26.175 --> 00:21:27.375
It'll be hot, won't it?

00:21:28.555 --> 00:21:30.165
Then let's install AC.

00:21:33.165 --> 00:21:34.165
Thanks.

00:21:34.735 --> 00:21:35.735
What else?

00:21:36.025 --> 00:21:37.895
I want to travel abroad for the first time.

00:21:39.035 --> 00:21:40.035
Where do you want to go?

00:21:40.445 --> 00:21:41.895
I'll take you.

00:21:42.875 --> 00:21:44.145
We can go diving in Thailand.

00:21:46.445 --> 00:21:47.795
After that, let's go to Canada.

00:21:48.345 --> 00:21:49.815
I studied abroad there.

00:21:50.595 --> 00:21:51.795
It'll be a lot of fun.

00:22:01.055 --> 00:22:02.335
I'm so happy.

00:22:05.395 --> 00:22:06.665
I'm happy, too.

00:22:08.905 --> 00:22:10.105
Good night, Kaishin.

00:22:15.925 --> 00:22:17.125
Good night.

00:22:17.985 --> 00:22:18.985
Ai-san?

00:23:11.825 --> 00:23:12.825
Can't sleep?

00:23:14.005 --> 00:23:15.005
Yeah.

00:23:16.305 --> 00:23:18.035
Go put on your own pajamas.

00:23:19.645 --> 00:23:20.745
Are you kidding me?

00:23:27.525 --> 00:23:29.065
I'm just so excited.

00:23:30.205 --> 00:23:31.935
Thinking about my future with Kaishin...

00:23:32.775 --> 00:23:34.875
I'm too excited to sleep.

00:23:36.055 --> 00:23:37.435
I'm such a kid.

00:23:38.565 --> 00:23:39.565
Well then

00:23:39.875 --> 00:23:42.405
let's be two kids staying up past our bedtime.

00:23:42.875 --> 00:23:44.075
Want to sneak out?

00:23:45.975 --> 00:23:46.975
- It lit!
- It did!

00:23:47.035 --> 00:23:48.035
It's lit!

00:23:48.495 --> 00:23:49.525
Ai-san, you've never...

00:23:49.725 --> 00:23:51.095
set off fireworks at the beach before,
have you?

00:23:51.095 --> 00:23:52.195
Never.

00:23:52.855 --> 00:23:53.925
It's so beautiful.

00:23:54.335 --> 00:23:55.565
This is amazing.

00:23:56.005 --> 00:23:57.455
- It's so pretty.
- Look.

00:23:58.935 --> 00:24:00.435
What do you think I wrote?

00:24:00.855 --> 00:24:02.225
Oh, I knew it instantly.

00:24:02.255 --> 00:24:03.455
- What is it?
- Ai!

00:24:04.175 --> 00:24:05.175
You got it.

00:24:05.575 --> 00:24:06.575
Amazing.

00:24:06.655 --> 00:24:07.985
You knew right away.

00:24:08.305 --> 00:24:10.535
- That's my Ai-san.
- Well, you're easy to read.

00:24:12.085 --> 00:24:13.085
But...

00:24:13.215 --> 00:24:14.415
No one here.

00:24:14.645 --> 00:24:16.175
It's so peaceful.

00:24:16.785 --> 00:24:17.885
What are you smiling about?

00:24:19.015 --> 00:24:21.265
I am just remembering when we came here to see the stars.

00:24:22.395 --> 00:24:23.595
It feels like so long ago.

00:24:24.525 --> 00:24:26.085
I was so arrogant back then.

00:24:26.785 --> 00:24:27.965
You were.

00:24:28.435 --> 00:24:30.265
I'd never met anyone so arrogant.

00:24:30.825 --> 00:24:31.825
Mmm.

00:24:34.705 --> 00:24:36.105
Back then, I...

00:24:37.225 --> 00:24:38.925
felt like I was the luckiest person.

00:24:40.385 --> 00:24:42.395
I was the one who was saved that day.

00:24:43.735 --> 00:24:46.095
Even knowing our time was limited.

00:24:46.805 --> 00:24:49.065
I wanted to throw caution to the wind
and go after you.

00:24:50.615 --> 00:24:52.975
I felt like I'd never get another chance like it.

00:24:54.765 --> 00:24:56.075
Thank you, Ai-san.

00:24:57.285 --> 00:24:58.285
For what?

00:24:59.375 --> 00:25:00.935
For being by my side.

00:25:03.265 --> 00:25:05.565
I used to imagine that waking up next to you

00:25:07.565 --> 00:25:09.785
would be the greatest happiness.

00:25:12.795 --> 00:25:14.005
But now...

00:25:14.285 --> 00:25:15.625
I've gotten greedier.

00:25:19.095 --> 00:25:21.115
I want to build a future with you.

00:25:22.525 --> 00:25:24.135
I can picture it.

00:25:27.765 --> 00:25:28.995
I can see it, too.

00:25:31.225 --> 00:25:32.225
Kaishin.

00:25:33.715 --> 00:25:34.715
I...

00:25:36.485 --> 00:25:38.135
love you from the bottom of my heart.

00:25:43.755 --> 00:25:45.485
I don't know if forever exists

00:25:46.495 --> 00:25:47.495
but...

00:25:49.045 --> 00:25:50.145
can I believe in it?

00:25:53.805 --> 00:25:55.515
Out of 10, what's my score?

00:25:56.965 --> 00:25:57.965
An 8.

00:26:07.085 --> 00:26:08.365
Because I like the number 8.

00:26:28.145 --> 00:26:29.985
For whatever led me to this person

00:26:31.275 --> 00:26:32.475
to all of this.

00:26:33.215 --> 00:26:34.485
I am so grateful.

00:27:06.625 --> 00:27:07.625
I love you.

00:27:09.595 --> 00:27:10.595
What's wrong?

00:27:12.765 --> 00:27:14.515
Because I am sleepy in mornings.

00:27:16.185 --> 00:27:17.185
Come on.

00:27:17.805 --> 00:27:19.685
The two of them are waiting for us for breakfast.

00:27:23.755 --> 00:27:24.755
I love you.

00:27:26.255 --> 00:27:27.855
I want to spend my mornings with you, too.

00:27:44.875 --> 00:27:45.875
Okay.

00:27:48.925 --> 00:27:49.925
Let's go.

00:27:54.105 --> 00:27:56.665
Ah, I'm starving.

00:28:00.295 --> 00:28:03.865
Teacher Ai, Kaishin-san.

00:28:04.845 --> 00:28:06.145
Good morning.

00:28:07.055 --> 00:28:08.315
How are you feeling?

00:28:08.535 --> 00:28:10.495
Looks like I don't even need to ask.

00:28:12.015 --> 00:28:13.535
You two look so happy.

00:28:14.545 --> 00:28:15.745
Look who's talking.

00:28:21.525 --> 00:28:22.725
As for me.

00:28:24.195 --> 00:28:25.965
I'm the

00:28:26.475 --> 00:28:28.645
happiest person in the world.

00:28:31.295 --> 00:28:32.945
No, I am

00:28:33.665 --> 00:28:35.665
the happiest person.

00:28:46.705 --> 00:28:47.705
Let's go have breakfast.

00:28:48.335 --> 00:28:49.335
Yeah.

00:28:58.985 --> 00:29:00.305
Happiness...

00:29:00.895 --> 00:29:02.865
It's like a boat crossing the sea.

00:29:04.215 --> 00:29:06.375
Looking back at the passing by

00:29:06.965 --> 00:29:09.135
while gazing into the eyes of the person in front

00:29:10.015 --> 00:29:13.115
rowing together toward an unknown future.

00:29:14.125 --> 00:29:15.125
No matter when

00:29:15.365 --> 00:29:17.225
we head toward an ocean vaster than today.

00:31:01.455 --> 00:31:02.555
Himeka-san.

00:31:04.095 --> 00:31:05.595
I'm also happy, too.

00:31:06.185 --> 00:31:07.475
Hey, Fumi.

00:31:07.895 --> 00:31:09.725
We're dating now.
When will you stop using honorifics?

00:31:11.965 --> 00:31:13.385
You two are dating?

00:31:14.155 --> 00:31:16.035
It was quite a journey.

00:31:16.525 --> 00:31:17.985
It was a total ambush.

00:31:19.315 --> 00:31:20.885
Fumi's a wolf in sheep's clothing.

00:31:21.195 --> 00:31:22.995
She almost had her way with me.

00:31:23.645 --> 00:31:24.945
Almost had her way with you?!

00:31:25.655 --> 00:31:30.365
- Oh, give me a break!
- Way to go, Fumi!
