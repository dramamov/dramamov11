00:00:13.427 --> 00:00:15.840
(A True Devil Resides
within the Imperial Harem!)

00:00:15.988 --> 00:00:18.784
(Yongxiu Palace)

00:00:20.704 --> 00:00:21.800
Your Ladyship.

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:22.840
We found the maid

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:23.968
you've been looking for.

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:25.000
Is it Ling Zhu?

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:26.200
Yes.

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:27.640
You've predicted it perfectly.

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:30.560
Today is the bathing day
for maids at the bathhouse.

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:32.320
Ling Zhu indeed appeared.

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:35.720
How did you know Ling Zhu
would go to the bathhouse today?

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:39.440
Since Consort Wan claimed Ling Zhu,

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:41.560
she has never left Chengxi Palace.

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:42.752
There's no news at all.

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:44.800
But Consort Wan is a tidy person.

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:47.920
She'd never tolerate odors
on her personal maids.

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.560
She'll eventually
permit Ling Zhu to bathe.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.032
And this

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:53.680
is the opportunity I awaited.

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:12.720
Greetings,

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:13.880
Your Ladyship.

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:15.400
You still remember me?

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:16.720
Yes, I do.

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:19.160
I once judged others
with blind arrogance

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:21.680
and offended you
at the Fragrance Bureau.

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:23.600
I beg your forgiveness.

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:25.440
Get up.

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:26.592
Thank you, Your Ladyship.

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:37.160
I heard

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:38.520
you were sent to Chengxi Palace.

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:40.576
How have you been?

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:42.440
I'm fine.

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:44.640
Thank you for your concern.

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:46.280
Having been in Chengxi Palace myself,

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:47.960
I know precisely

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:49.480
how you have been.

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:51.360
Her Highness

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:53.520
treats me tolerably.

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:56.840
Do you remember Cui Wei?

00:01:57.400 --> 00:01:59.040
When she was in the Servitude Bureau,

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:01.440
she always claimed to serve Consort Wan

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:02.720
loyally.

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:05.280
But when Consort Wan ordered her death,

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:07.000
she never spared a thought

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:08.400
for your loyal service

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:10.080
to her.

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:13.760
It's not easy for you
to leave Chengxi Palace.

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:15.880
Whether you get to see me again

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:18.000
depends on your fortune.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:18.976
I...

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:24.160
Both you and Cui Wei
knew Consort Wan's secrets.

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:27.160
She eliminates all who know them.

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:30.016
Ling Zhu.

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:31.160
You should know

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:33.080
I'm not your enemy.

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:35.400
If you want to live,

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:36.768
just tell me

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:38.760
back in the Fragrance Bureau,

00:02:39.076 --> 00:02:40.096
what did you and Cui Wei

00:02:40.096 --> 00:02:41.720
do for Consort Wan?

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:45.560
Your Ladyship, please help me.

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:47.160
If only I could

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:48.880
escape the terrible Chengxi Palace,

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:50.560
I'd tell you everything.

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:52.160
Consort Wan...

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:54.360
Consort Wan has gone mad.

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:01.344
Lord Wu.

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:03.360
What's this?

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:05.480
It's from Consort Wan's palace.

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:07.600
You can have
an imperial physician verify

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:09.312
what this is.

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:11.120
If you have nothing else to command,

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:13.200
I shall attend His Majesty's affairs.

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:15.616
I'll take my leave.

00:03:17.472 --> 00:03:18.202
My lord,

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:20.840
I once made use of you.

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:22.720
I owe you deeply.

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:24.800
But what happened today is serious.

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:26.880
I act not for myself alone,

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:28.920
but for innocent palace dwellers.

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:32.704
I believe

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:34.320
after investigating,

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:36.160
you won't just stand by.

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:41.568
What do you mean?

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:43.680
When you confirm

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:45.360
what's in this bottle,

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:47.168
you'll believe

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:48.760
a true devil

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:50.960
resides within the imperial harem.

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:07.712
Greetings, Your Majesty.

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:09.344
What is it?

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:11.808
Your Majesty,

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:13.680
Consort Wan has been unwell lately.

00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:15.424
Alone in her palace,

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:16.544
with no one to visit,

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:18.160
she looks quite forlorn.

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:20.040
Consort Wan...

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:23.520
It's been too long since I saw her.

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:25.960
I wonder how her reflection is.

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:30.080
I'll go to Yongxiu Palace.

00:04:32.243 --> 00:04:33.216
Yes.

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:37.120
Procession to Yongxiu Palace.

00:04:37.363 --> 00:04:38.816
(Yongxiu Palace)

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:41.055
Greetings, Your Ladyship.

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:43.160
What's the matter?

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:44.608
Your Ladyship,

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:46.000
His Majesty is on his way here.

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:47.120
Please get prepared.

00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:49.520
His Majesty didn't go to Chengxi Palace?

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:51.080
He was originally headed there,

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:52.400
but he changed his mind.

00:04:52.544 --> 00:04:53.400
My master sent me

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:54.496
to inform you in advance.

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:56.224
Thank you.

00:05:09.728 --> 00:05:10.528
Why are you crying?

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:12.320
Your blood

00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:14.360
will be the primer
for Her Highness's rebirth,

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:16.360
restoring her beauty.

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:17.360
Consider it an honor.

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:20.040
Stop crying.

00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:20.992
Such bad luck.

00:05:21.984 --> 00:05:23.000
Your Highness,

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:24.480
I came from humble origins.

00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:26.440
My blood is filthy and worthless.

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:28.560
Your Highness, please spare me.

00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:30.784
Ling Zhu,

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:33.240
you were personally selected
by Sun Meizi

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:34.760
at the Fragrance Bureau.

00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:37.200
She spent years searching there

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:39.040
and only found a few like you

00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:41.160
who share my exact birth chart.

00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:43.360
How rare this is.

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:45.760
Each of you is my treasure.

00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:49.160
If you obediently
donate your blood to me,

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:51.280
I'll ensure you're well rewarded.

00:05:51.616 --> 00:05:52.560
Your Highness,

00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:53.560
at the Fragrance Bureau,

00:05:53.640 --> 00:05:55.600
Madam Sun prepared Asuji Pills for you,

00:05:56.160 --> 00:05:58.240
using our maiden blood as the primer.

00:05:58.360 --> 00:06:00.240
But now that Madam Sun is gone,

00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:02.000
no one can make the Asuji Pills.

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:02.960
Even if you demand more,

00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:05.160
our blood is useless now, Your Highness.

00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:06.120
Please spare me.

00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:07.040
Shut up!

00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:08.800
How could Asuji Pills

00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:10.760
compare to this secret
beauty-restoration art.

00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:13.760
I'm on the verge of success.

00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:15.800
After tonight,

00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:19.560
I'll regain my former peerless beauty.

00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:25.840
Considering your diligent service,

00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:27.880
I'll overlook your impertinence.

00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:30.160
But if you dare defy me again,

00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:33.160
you'll end up like Cui Wei.

00:06:40.820 --> 00:06:41.664
Hand.

00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:46.336
Don't cry!

00:06:55.348 --> 00:06:56.288
Go.

00:07:21.152 --> 00:07:23.160
(Yongxiu Palace)
His Majesty has arrived.

00:07:27.440 --> 00:07:29.480
May Your Majesty be ever blessed
and in peace.

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:31.008
Where is Noble Lady Yun?

00:07:31.520 --> 00:07:32.680
She went to Chengxi Palace.

00:07:33.560 --> 00:07:34.600
Why did she go there?

00:07:35.400 --> 00:07:36.576
Your Majesty,

00:07:36.720 --> 00:07:38.400
before leaving,
Her Ladyship instructed me

00:07:38.760 --> 00:07:40.240
that if you came to Yongxiu Palace,

00:07:40.360 --> 00:07:41.520
I shall tell you

00:07:41.920 --> 00:07:44.440
she went to visit the ailing Consort Wan
in Chengxi Palace.

00:07:44.960 --> 00:07:45.960
Her Ladyship said

00:07:45.960 --> 00:07:48.200
although she and Consort Wan
are estranged at heart,

00:07:48.640 --> 00:07:49.960
she should follow palace rules.

00:07:50.560 --> 00:07:51.960
As a lower-ranking Noble Lady,

00:07:52.200 --> 00:07:53.840
she should serve the ailing Consort Wan.

00:07:55.720 --> 00:07:56.672
Go to Chengxi Palace.

00:08:09.120 --> 00:08:10.800
You think damaging my face

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:13.480
will prevent my return to favor?

00:08:15.720 --> 00:08:16.576
Today,

00:08:17.600 --> 00:08:19.360
I'll use the forbidden art
of the entertainer

00:08:20.400 --> 00:08:21.880
to offer blood to the Joy Deity,

00:08:23.160 --> 00:08:24.560
and show my restored beauty

00:08:24.560 --> 00:08:25.480
to all of you.

00:08:27.960 --> 00:08:28.920
Your Highness,

00:08:28.920 --> 00:08:30.480
the Yin hour approaches.

00:08:31.160 --> 00:08:33.960
There's only one chance
every three years for blood rebirth.

00:08:34.760 --> 00:08:36.760
Finding these individuals
sharing your birth chart

00:08:36.760 --> 00:08:38.240
is extremely difficult.

00:08:38.760 --> 00:08:40.440
I will guard outside

00:08:40.960 --> 00:08:43.760
to ensure no one
disrupts your grand endeavor.

00:08:47.760 --> 00:08:49.840
His Majesty has arrived.

00:08:55.240 --> 00:08:56.192
What should I do?

00:09:04.920 --> 00:09:06.920
May Your Majesty be ever blessed
and in peace.

00:09:07.120 --> 00:09:08.032
Rise.

00:09:09.800 --> 00:09:10.880
I heard you are unwell,

00:09:11.200 --> 00:09:12.160
so I came to see you.

00:09:12.160 --> 00:09:13.240
Thank you for your concern.

00:09:13.560 --> 00:09:14.720
I'm fine.

00:09:16.560 --> 00:09:17.536
Your Majesty,

00:09:18.840 --> 00:09:21.320
I've been reflecting
on my past actions recently.

00:09:21.800 --> 00:09:23.360
Henceforth, I'll be cautious

00:09:24.040 --> 00:09:25.200
and won't let you down.

00:09:25.920 --> 00:09:27.120
I'll see your future behavior.

00:09:28.960 --> 00:09:29.920
Your Majesty,

00:09:31.920 --> 00:09:33.720
I've been feeling unwell lately.

00:09:34.240 --> 00:09:35.600
The chamber air is stale.

00:09:36.120 --> 00:09:37.360
Your health is paramount.

00:09:37.720 --> 00:09:40.960
Don't risk harming it
with this foul air.

00:09:42.160 --> 00:09:43.480
Consort Wan is right.

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:45.320
Your health is paramount.

00:09:45.600 --> 00:09:46.880
You'd better not go inside.

00:09:47.760 --> 00:09:48.672
Tong An.

00:09:49.160 --> 00:09:51.880
Ask someone to bring a chair
for His Majesty now.

00:09:52.720 --> 00:09:55.456
Let His Majesty and Consort Wan
enjoy the moonlight here

00:09:55.456 --> 00:09:56.352
and talk for a while.

00:09:56.352 --> 00:09:57.216
Yes.

00:09:59.392 --> 00:10:00.288
- Summon the physicians.
- Yes.

00:10:00.288 --> 00:10:01.248
There's no need.

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:03.480
They check my pulse daily.

00:10:04.160 --> 00:10:05.000
I

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:06.680
have merely been fatigued lately,

00:10:07.040 --> 00:10:07.968
easily wearied.

00:10:08.400 --> 00:10:09.560
More rest will suffice.

00:10:10.320 --> 00:10:11.160
Then rest well.

00:10:11.960 --> 00:10:12.992
Focus on recuperating.

00:10:13.520 --> 00:10:14.560
Your Majesty,

00:10:14.920 --> 00:10:16.120
please wait a moment.

00:10:16.520 --> 00:10:18.000
I sent people to the Imperial Kitchen

00:10:18.160 --> 00:10:20.200
for special red ginseng
and bird's nest soup

00:10:20.720 --> 00:10:22.240
to replenish Consort Wan's vitality.

00:10:23.360 --> 00:10:24.920
You have been overworked recently.

00:10:25.400 --> 00:10:26.760
Please take a bowl as well.

00:10:27.040 --> 00:10:28.096
Alright.

00:10:28.240 --> 00:10:29.360
I happen to be hungry.

00:10:30.200 --> 00:10:31.200
Tonight's moonlight

00:10:31.720 --> 00:10:32.576
is rather splendid.

00:10:33.320 --> 00:10:34.440
Let's stay in this courtyard

00:10:34.960 --> 00:10:35.808
to admire the moon

00:10:36.360 --> 00:10:37.440
and enjoy the soup.

00:10:42.640 --> 00:10:44.160
Noble Lady Yun, you're so thoughtful.

00:10:44.600 --> 00:10:46.760
I only do my duty.

00:11:02.240 --> 00:11:03.120
It's late.

00:11:03.760 --> 00:11:05.200
Moon-viewing with me for two hours,

00:11:05.840 --> 00:11:06.752
you should rest early.

00:11:08.720 --> 00:11:10.360
Your Highness, please take care.

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:13.600
Farewell, Your Majesty.

00:11:32.960 --> 00:11:33.960
Return to Yongxiu Palace.

00:11:36.920 --> 00:11:37.760
I'll take my leave.

00:11:45.720 --> 00:11:46.752
Summon Wu Linfu.

00:11:51.744 --> 00:11:52.760
Your Highness,

00:11:52.760 --> 00:11:54.120
the appointed time has passed.

00:11:54.640 --> 00:11:56.000
What should we do now?

00:11:56.920 --> 00:11:57.960
That vile woman.

00:11:58.760 --> 00:11:59.760
I'll kill her!

00:12:02.320 --> 00:12:03.424
Useless!

00:12:04.520 --> 00:12:05.568
Incompetent fools!

00:12:05.720 --> 00:12:06.720
Incompetent fools!

00:12:07.320 --> 00:12:08.200
Incompetent fools!

00:12:08.600 --> 00:12:09.640
What use are any of you?

00:12:27.136 --> 00:12:28.160
Greetings,

00:12:28.160 --> 00:12:29.216
Your Majesty.

00:12:29.360 --> 00:12:30.336
Wu Linfu,

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:32.000
do you confess?

00:12:35.200 --> 00:12:36.600
I willingly accept punishment.

00:12:37.240 --> 00:12:38.160
Please make it clear.

00:12:39.760 --> 00:12:40.880
Tonight,

00:12:40.880 --> 00:12:43.200
you reminded me of my long absence
from Consort Wan first.

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:44.960
At the Yongxiu Palace,

00:12:45.160 --> 00:12:46.208
before I entered the hall,

00:12:46.800 --> 00:12:47.840
Noble Lady Yun diverted me

00:12:48.068 --> 00:12:49.568
to see Consort Wan in Chengxi Palace.

00:12:50.240 --> 00:12:51.120
Tell me.

00:12:51.600 --> 00:12:52.560
Is it all coincidence?

00:12:53.560 --> 00:12:54.624
I know I was wrong.

00:12:55.640 --> 00:12:56.600
It was my negligence

00:12:57.280 --> 00:12:58.560
for intervening in your affairs.

00:12:59.200 --> 00:13:00.160
I beg for punishment.

00:13:01.160 --> 00:13:02.640
The discord between them

00:13:03.160 --> 00:13:04.920
is a matter between harem consorts.

00:13:05.200 --> 00:13:06.320
Why do you

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:08.040
side with Noble Lady Yun?

00:13:08.040 --> 00:13:09.024
I wouldn't dare.

00:13:09.560 --> 00:13:10.560
I beg for punishment.

00:13:12.440 --> 00:13:13.560
I heard palace rumors

00:13:14.140 --> 00:13:15.620
that you are close to Noble Lady Yun.

00:13:16.640 --> 00:13:17.920
I trust your conduct

00:13:18.320 --> 00:13:19.200
will not make trouble.

00:13:20.240 --> 00:13:21.120
With what I saw today,

00:13:21.640 --> 00:13:22.640
can I still trust you?

00:13:25.400 --> 00:13:26.720
I know I was wrong.
