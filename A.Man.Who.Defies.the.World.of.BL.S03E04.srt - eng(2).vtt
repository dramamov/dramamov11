00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:19.730
I need to talk to you alone.

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:26.580
Wh-what should I do now?

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:28.540
What am I gonna do?

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:37.160
So then...

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:41.420
Hatano said he couldn't talk freely at home.

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:43.650
So that's why we came here.

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:46.670
Um...

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:49.700
It's about the other day.

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:54.460
Uh...

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:56.190
Yeah.

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:58.480
Um...

00:00:58.810 --> 00:00:59.810
Huh?

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:03.530
I like you.

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:06.560
What should I do?

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:09.210
This might be a bit overdue,

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:11.840
but I should probably turn him down for good.

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:14.570
- So, um...
- About your confession the other day.

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:16.720
I was thinking maybe...

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:19.010
Could you just put that on hold for now?

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:22.870
Huh?

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:37.490
Huh?

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:40.560
He gave up before I even did anything?

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:43.020
No, he said he was putting it on hold,

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:44.660
but that's basically...

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:46.010
Um...

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:47.590
Why?

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:50.730
That's because...

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:54.490
That's because...

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:00.580
That's because...

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:04.040
Uh...

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:06.930
Why are you giving me those puppy-dog eyes?

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:09.340
Aren't those...

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:11.350
the eyes of someone in love?

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:13.170
Hey, stop it.

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:14.840
Don't look at me like that.

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:18.370
Um... You

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:21.090
don't seem to remember what happened then.

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:25.080
I just got swept up in the moment and confessed.

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:28.390
I didn't even think about
how much trouble I was causing you.

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:32.160
This guy...

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:34.940
He's surprisingly level-headed.

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:38.060
I'm sorry.

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:41.470
No, you don't have to apologize.

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:42.230
Also...

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:45.760
The main reason is...

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:49.120
Reason?

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:50.950
The reason is...

00:03:56.330 --> 00:03:57.530
Huh?

00:03:57.850 --> 00:04:00.250
You pervert, preying on a minor!

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:01.880
Preying on?

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:04.800
You belong in jail.

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:08.730
Wait, agh...

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:10.350
Give me a chance to explain!

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:12.300
At least let me have a trial!

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:14.280
Even a background character deserves a fair trial!

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:19.110
If you dated a minor like me,

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:21.540
they say on TV that you'd get arrested.

00:04:21.830 --> 00:04:24.840
Was Hatano just imagining all that?

00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:27.620
But seriously, high schoolers these days...

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:30.360
are way too law-abiding.

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:32.690
Whoa.

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:37.320
Thr...

00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:38.890
Three years...

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:40.280
In three years,

00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:42.240
when I turn twenty, I'll tell you again.

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:44.020
That I like you.

00:04:45.170 --> 00:04:46.170
I...

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:49.410
have no intention of giving up on you.

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:53.880
So,

00:04:54.450 --> 00:04:55.450
um...

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:58.340
that's all I wanted to tell you.

00:05:01.410 --> 00:05:02.410
I'll be going now.

00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:08.150
Three years.

00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:11.140
What he means by three years is...

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:14.250
Wait a minute.

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:16.000
With three years to go,

00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:18.320
he'll probably give up sometime in between.

00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:21.670
It'd be naive to think that.

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:23.610
If I just let him go like this,

00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:28.400
I know for a fact that a bunch of tropey,
flag-raising events will happen.

00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:31.230
Therefore,

00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:34.200
I absolutely cannot let him get away.

00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:38.240
My, my.

00:05:38.410 --> 00:05:40.280
Look at that spirited young man.

00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:44.460
So full of youth.

00:05:44.790 --> 00:05:45.790
Youth indeed.

00:05:52.430 --> 00:05:53.630
Right here...

00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:55.780
I have to take down this flag right here...

00:05:56.190 --> 00:05:57.580
I have to break it.

00:05:59.300 --> 00:06:00.300
No.

00:06:00.340 --> 00:06:01.850
On second thought...

00:06:01.980 --> 00:06:05.580
A college slacker who just eats snacks
and plays video games all day...

00:06:05.580 --> 00:06:06.110
Wait...

00:06:06.180 --> 00:06:09.390
has no chance of catching up
to a healthy high school student.

00:06:27.980 --> 00:06:29.230
I'm home.

00:06:35.180 --> 00:06:37.050
(Still Recovering)
He's still not better.

00:06:37.960 --> 00:06:40.010
You're going to fail out of college.

00:06:46.540 --> 00:06:47.740
Three years later.

00:06:48.290 --> 00:06:51.010
To prepare for the day that guy shows up again,

00:06:51.740 --> 00:06:54.440
and in order to break every flag,

00:06:54.620 --> 00:06:57.340
I began to conduct further research.

00:07:08.920 --> 00:07:09.920
Agh...

00:07:09.950 --> 00:07:11.270
My eyes are so sore.

00:07:12.060 --> 00:07:13.300
This is what you use for times like these.

00:07:14.140 --> 00:07:16.400
Blueberries for eye health.

00:07:34.280 --> 00:07:35.510
This is kind of sudden,

00:07:35.950 --> 00:07:38.630
but today is my little brother's high school festival.

00:07:39.200 --> 00:07:40.450
Brings back memories.

00:07:43.600 --> 00:07:46.680
I came here today on a mission.

00:07:50.870 --> 00:07:53.700
For our grandparents who live in the countryside,

00:07:53.720 --> 00:07:58.360
I have to film Ayato in his school play.

00:07:58.840 --> 00:08:00.850
I'm such a model grandson.

00:08:01.760 --> 00:08:03.160
That's me, a background character.

00:08:04.200 --> 00:08:05.200
Ladies and gentlemen,

00:08:05.330 --> 00:08:07.800
the Class 2-2 play is about to begin.

00:08:10.900 --> 00:08:11.900
Alright.

00:08:11.930 --> 00:08:15.070
I've gotta get a good shot of Ayato.

00:08:15.790 --> 00:08:17.230
For the allowance money.

00:08:17.900 --> 00:08:18.900
No, I mean...

00:08:19.020 --> 00:08:21.570
for the love of my grandparents.

The School Festival

00:08:30.020 --> 00:08:31.390
When you think of classic school plays,

00:08:31.780 --> 00:08:32.780
you think of...

00:08:33.410 --> 00:08:34.610
Mother.

00:08:34.840 --> 00:08:37.440
It is almost time to prepare for the ball.

00:08:38.080 --> 00:08:39.040
You are right.

00:08:40.230 --> 00:08:41.230
Cinderella...

00:08:41.920 --> 00:08:43.690
You must wash these dishes as well.

00:08:44.680 --> 00:08:46.590
Yes, Mother.

00:08:47.880 --> 00:08:48.880
- That's right.
- I'm so excited.

00:08:49.050 --> 00:08:50.210
It's Cinderella.

00:08:50.210 --> 00:08:51.800
Yes, Mother.

00:08:56.460 --> 00:08:57.460
Oh...

00:08:58.350 --> 00:08:59.720
I also...

00:09:00.170 --> 00:09:02.740
wish I could go to the ball at the castle.

00:09:03.240 --> 00:09:04.320
But,

00:09:06.690 --> 00:09:08.900
no matter how sad things are now,

00:09:09.410 --> 00:09:10.690
if you just keep believing,

00:09:10.730 --> 00:09:13.260
your dreams will one day come true.

00:09:13.970 --> 00:09:15.750
Just for the record,

00:09:15.810 --> 00:09:17.550
this isn't an all-boys school.

00:09:18.460 --> 00:09:20.700
It's a genuine co-ed school.

00:09:21.650 --> 00:09:23.190
Where the heck is he?

00:09:29.070 --> 00:09:30.070
But...

00:09:30.190 --> 00:09:34.640
as you can see,
the main cast of Cinderella is all male.

00:09:38.440 --> 00:09:39.440
That's right.

00:09:40.480 --> 00:09:42.870
Because this is the world of BL.

00:09:45.540 --> 00:09:46.540
You...

00:09:46.900 --> 00:09:48.570
You are my destiny.

00:09:50.030 --> 00:09:51.030
Your Highness...

00:09:53.390 --> 00:09:54.390
Who are you?

00:09:55.170 --> 00:09:56.170
What is your name?

00:09:58.630 --> 00:10:00.000
My name is...

00:10:00.360 --> 00:10:02.060
"Dong."

00:10:04.180 --> 00:10:05.850
I am sorry, Your Highness.

00:10:09.670 --> 00:10:10.670
Wait!

00:10:23.480 --> 00:10:25.040
Who...

00:10:26.050 --> 00:10:27.570
Who was that?

00:10:32.040 --> 00:10:36.520
Who on earth was that?

00:10:37.200 --> 00:10:38.200
Still,

00:10:38.240 --> 00:10:39.730
this glass slipper thing,

00:10:39.840 --> 00:10:42.070
is actually kind of terrifying when you think about it.

00:10:42.650 --> 00:10:44.010
It'd be painful to wear,

00:10:44.200 --> 00:10:46.120
and if you fell, it'd shatter
and you'd be covered in blood.

00:10:47.680 --> 00:10:48.680
Wait.

00:10:48.740 --> 00:10:49.740
More importantly,

00:10:49.910 --> 00:10:51.860
where is my little brother?

00:10:55.320 --> 00:10:56.320
"Neigh..."

00:10:57.130 --> 00:10:58.630
"Neigh..."

00:10:59.520 --> 00:11:00.520
Huh?

00:11:01.410 --> 00:11:03.430
Is that my brother?

00:11:04.300 --> 00:11:07.420
In this world of BL, he's definitely a main character.

00:11:07.480 --> 00:11:10.030
And he's Tojo's boyfriend. My brother is...

00:11:10.500 --> 00:11:11.700
playing a horse?

00:11:16.230 --> 00:11:17.810
There's no way.

00:11:20.960 --> 00:11:23.720
I thought the main attraction of this festival

00:11:24.040 --> 00:11:28.430
would obviously be the handsome couple,
Ayato and Tojo.

00:11:29.350 --> 00:11:31.170
Turns out it's another couple this time.

00:11:36.210 --> 00:11:38.270
That's right. Those two.

00:11:39.480 --> 00:11:40.480
I knew it.

00:11:40.760 --> 00:11:43.380
The person I met that night really was you.

00:11:44.560 --> 00:11:45.760
I...

00:11:45.800 --> 00:11:47.510
love you from the bottom of my heart.

00:11:47.760 --> 00:11:48.860
Cinderella.

00:11:50.130 --> 00:11:52.310
I love you too, Your Highness...

00:11:58.450 --> 00:11:59.550
I...

00:12:05.670 --> 00:12:06.670
No.

00:12:12.040 --> 00:12:14.090
I'm not Cinderella.

00:12:18.980 --> 00:12:20.130
My name...

00:12:22.110 --> 00:12:23.210
Say my name properly.

00:12:31.420 --> 00:12:32.420
Haruhiko.

00:12:35.450 --> 00:12:37.180
Ever since I saw you at the entrance ceremony,

00:12:38.450 --> 00:12:39.550
I've always liked you.

00:12:43.830 --> 00:12:44.830
Reiji...

00:12:47.580 --> 00:12:48.580
Me too.

00:13:02.260 --> 00:13:03.350
This is amazing!

00:13:05.230 --> 00:13:07.090
This is the world of BL, after all.

00:13:07.680 --> 00:13:09.360
The school festival stage...

00:13:09.430 --> 00:13:12.440
unexpectedly became the setting for a love confession.

00:13:25.550 --> 00:13:26.550
And just like that,

00:13:27.040 --> 00:13:31.250
our production of "Cinderella,"
full of the cast's real-life drama,

00:13:31.360 --> 00:13:33.210
drew to a close.

00:13:49.980 --> 00:13:51.240
Here comes the money shot.

00:13:51.970 --> 00:13:53.620
Here I come, my allowance.

00:13:55.380 --> 00:13:56.670
Grandma, Grandpa,

00:14:08.330 --> 00:14:09.530
thank you so much.

00:14:10.190 --> 00:14:12.030
- Thank you, everyone.
- Thank you very much.

00:14:36.510 --> 00:14:37.760
Great job.

00:14:38.230 --> 00:14:39.230
Tojo...

00:14:49.360 --> 00:14:50.360
What's wrong?

00:14:50.410 --> 00:14:51.610
You look down.

00:14:53.800 --> 00:14:54.800
It's just...

00:14:56.620 --> 00:14:57.620
Hmm?

00:15:01.620 --> 00:15:02.620
I...

00:15:03.910 --> 00:15:05.420
I messed up.

00:15:06.230 --> 00:15:07.430
Messed up?

00:15:07.670 --> 00:15:08.670
How did you mess up?

00:15:10.690 --> 00:15:11.890
In the middle of the play,

00:15:13.090 --> 00:15:14.290
I tripped.

00:15:18.610 --> 00:15:20.300
Don't worry about it.

00:15:22.240 --> 00:15:23.240
But...

00:15:28.130 --> 00:15:29.690
Everyone's having a wrap party in the classroom.

00:15:29.920 --> 00:15:30.920
Let's go together.

00:15:32.580 --> 00:15:33.580
Okay.

00:15:37.240 --> 00:15:38.670
Are you okay?

00:15:54.570 --> 00:15:55.780
Here, take my hand.

00:15:59.050 --> 00:16:00.050
You dork...

00:16:05.740 --> 00:16:06.740
Are you alright?

00:16:08.290 --> 00:16:09.290
Get on my back.

00:16:15.300 --> 00:16:16.560
You're so light.

00:16:17.820 --> 00:16:19.020
Alright, and we're off!

00:16:19.340 --> 00:16:21.810
- Neigh~
- No, that's not it.

00:16:22.440 --> 00:16:23.440
Neigh~ neigh~!

00:16:23.800 --> 00:16:24.670
Neigh~ neigh~!

00:16:24.670 --> 00:16:26.280
Yes, yes, yes. Make it more high-pitched.

00:16:26.410 --> 00:16:28.020
Neigh~ neigh~!

00:16:30.040 --> 00:16:31.040
And then,

00:16:31.200 --> 00:16:32.830
one week later.

00:16:34.780 --> 00:16:35.780
Alright then.

00:16:35.810 --> 00:16:37.650
After a fair vote,

00:16:37.780 --> 00:16:39.170
the school festival play...

00:16:39.380 --> 00:16:41.120
has been decided. It's "Cinderella."

00:16:41.890 --> 00:16:42.890
Applause.

00:16:46.640 --> 00:16:50.220
Cinderella for a college festival play?

00:16:51.200 --> 00:16:55.420
Of course, it's because this is a BL world.

00:16:58.420 --> 00:16:59.420
Alright,

00:16:59.550 --> 00:17:02.110
let's decide who will play the prince.

00:17:02.900 --> 00:17:04.700
Any volunteers?

00:17:10.520 --> 00:17:11.880
No volunteers?

00:17:14.690 --> 00:17:16.570
Okay, how about any nominations?

00:17:16.850 --> 00:17:17.850
Class rep!

00:17:18.490 --> 00:17:19.390
Of course...

00:17:19.480 --> 00:17:21.440
The prince has to be Ouji, right?

00:17:21.960 --> 00:17:22.960
That's true.

00:17:23.050 --> 00:17:25.260
No one's a better fit for the prince than Ouji.

00:17:25.780 --> 00:17:26.980
It's decided then. Ouji it is.

00:17:29.370 --> 00:17:30.370
That's right.

00:17:30.600 --> 00:17:34.130
There's a guy in this class named Ouji.

00:17:34.270 --> 00:17:37.790
It's pronounced just like "ōji," which means prince.

00:17:38.080 --> 00:17:40.570
Usually, guys with cool names like that...

00:17:40.760 --> 00:17:43.240
can't live up to the name.

00:17:44.010 --> 00:17:45.010
But...

00:17:47.480 --> 00:17:48.480
No.

00:17:49.110 --> 00:17:50.110
This...

00:17:50.300 --> 00:17:51.300
This is bad.

00:17:53.060 --> 00:17:56.460
This Ouji is a literal prince.

00:17:57.050 --> 00:17:58.050
And so,

00:17:58.370 --> 00:17:59.570
just like that,

00:18:00.600 --> 00:18:01.920
the role of the prince...

00:18:02.120 --> 00:18:03.630
went to Ouji.

00:18:05.580 --> 00:18:06.880
Since I've been chosen,

00:18:07.190 --> 00:18:08.610
I'll do my absolute best.

00:18:18.540 --> 00:18:20.950
Next, we need to cast Cinderella.

00:18:21.090 --> 00:18:23.660
Oh, let's have Ouji pick someone.

00:18:23.940 --> 00:18:25.840
Hey, that's a great idea.

00:18:26.060 --> 00:18:27.550
Hey, but...

00:18:28.020 --> 00:18:29.020
Is that okay?

00:18:29.500 --> 00:18:30.500
Yeah.

00:18:31.200 --> 00:18:32.200
Ah...

00:18:32.600 --> 00:18:33.600
Well then...

00:18:35.590 --> 00:18:36.890
Naturally,

00:18:37.060 --> 00:18:39.540
his gaze fell upon a female classmate...

00:18:40.090 --> 00:18:41.090
As if.

00:18:41.670 --> 00:18:43.310
It fell upon a male classmate.

00:18:47.800 --> 00:18:50.470
But why, for the role of Cinderella?

00:18:52.700 --> 00:18:54.870
Isn't it obvious?

00:18:55.380 --> 00:18:58.340
Because this is the world of BL.

00:19:06.390 --> 00:19:07.590
This is bad.

00:19:07.750 --> 00:19:08.990
He's looking at me.

00:19:09.240 --> 00:19:10.440
This is a flag.

00:19:11.280 --> 00:19:13.280
It's a school festival flag.

00:19:14.170 --> 00:19:15.270
What do I do?

00:19:15.860 --> 00:19:16.960
What do I do?

00:19:17.580 --> 00:19:18.640
What's a mob character like me supposed to do?

00:19:18.640 --> 00:19:20.410
Excuse me. If you don't mind,

00:19:20.410 --> 00:19:21.750
- That's it!
- would you be my Cinderella?

00:19:21.750 --> 00:19:22.500
Neigh~!

00:19:30.040 --> 00:19:31.040
Idiot.

00:19:35.060 --> 00:19:36.200
Neigh~

00:19:36.540 --> 00:19:38.060
Lower your back a little more.

00:19:41.330 --> 00:19:42.040
Like this?

00:19:44.840 --> 00:19:45.840
Neigh~

00:19:46.080 --> 00:19:47.290
Hey.

00:19:47.920 --> 00:19:49.540
Don't just think about acting.

00:19:49.540 --> 00:19:51.620
You have to become the horse.

00:19:52.050 --> 00:19:53.660
- Become the horse...
- Yep.

00:20:00.880 --> 00:20:02.130
Neigh~

00:20:08.630 --> 00:20:09.630
Bro.

00:20:10.860 --> 00:20:12.900
Why did you volunteer to be the horse?

00:20:13.530 --> 00:20:14.530
Oh?

00:20:14.860 --> 00:20:17.300
Don't tell me you were moved by my amazing acting?

00:20:17.470 --> 00:20:19.150
You're way too optimistic...

00:20:19.230 --> 00:20:20.430
Okay, one more time.

00:20:29.700 --> 00:20:30.860
Neigh~!

00:20:35.720 --> 00:20:36.720
Yeah, that's good.

00:20:37.210 --> 00:20:38.210
That's really good.

00:20:40.630 --> 00:20:41.630
Hey...

00:20:42.500 --> 00:20:43.960
Let's take a break.

00:20:44.590 --> 00:20:45.810
Good idea.

00:20:48.320 --> 00:20:49.320
Then...

00:20:49.730 --> 00:20:51.810
Here, have this for a little boost.

00:20:53.040 --> 00:20:54.910
It'll taste even better if you truly become the horse.

00:20:55.140 --> 00:20:55.970
Huh?

00:20:56.000 --> 00:20:57.000
That's mine!

00:20:57.950 --> 00:20:58.950
Grandma, Grandpa,

00:20:59.320 --> 00:21:01.790
look forward to your grandson's brilliant performance.

00:21:01.960 --> 00:21:05.180
I'm going to give my all to the role of the horse.

00:21:05.880 --> 00:21:06.910
Neigh~ neigh~!

00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:13.000
"A Man Who Defies the World of BL 2024"

00:22:42.790 --> 00:22:43.790
(Next Episode)
Actually,

00:22:43.820 --> 00:22:45.810
the reason I started noticing Ayato...

00:22:45.830 --> 00:22:47.200
(VS The How We Fell In Love Chapter)
was because of pudding.

00:22:47.420 --> 00:22:49.100
Whenever a couple gets together,

00:22:49.230 --> 00:22:51.720
they're almost always asked one question.

00:22:51.930 --> 00:22:54.060
And that is the story of
how they met and fell in love.

00:22:54.920 --> 00:22:56.490
(VS The Helper Chapter)
Did things work out over here too?

00:22:56.910 --> 00:22:59.580
In this world of BL, even a mob character...

00:23:00.030 --> 00:23:02.440
can become a major flag.

00:23:03.960 --> 00:23:05.660
So, as long as I'm Mob A,

00:23:05.660 --> 00:23:07.860
I can't possibly trigger a flag.

00:23:08.310 --> 00:23:09.220
Huh?

00:23:09.220 --> 00:23:10.960
Why is this guy here?

00:23:10.960 --> 00:23:12.180
What the heck?
