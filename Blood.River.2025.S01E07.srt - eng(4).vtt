[Blood River]

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:33.980
[Based on the novel of the same name from Zhou Munan's Youth in Jianghu series]

[Episode 7]

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:42.330
Please wield the Dormant Dragon Sword

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:44.020
and inherit the title of Patriarch.

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:56.180
Lord Kui, please wield the Dormant Dragon Sword

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:58.210
and inherit the title of Patriarch.

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:01.900
All, rise.

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:20.850
I promise you.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:24.010
When this is over,

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:26.940
I will take you home,

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:30.170
with honor

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:33.260
and in freedom.

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:56.500
Sir.

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:19.570
Sir,

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:21.850
Senior Fanhua

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:24.170
was killed by the Su family

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:26.450
while seizing the Dormant Dragon Sword.

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:28.740
In the days after,

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:30.410
Senior Jinke, who was to receive him,

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:32.010
was ambushed,

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:33.890
no remains found.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:35.890
Fanhua,

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:37.780
your health was poor,

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:39.170
so no wine for you,

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:40.450
only tea.

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:42.980
You even said

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.140
tea would help you live longer.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:48.540
But I told you,

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:51.380
We're assassins.

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:53.260
We dance with death.

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:55.760
If fun lasts a day,

00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:58.780
we make it count.

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:04.290
My condolences, Sir.

[Xie Ba, head of the Xie family]

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:26.780
Where is Xie Qidao's disciple?

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:28.810
Xie Buxie lost to Su Muyu,

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:30.490
and then...

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:33.100
went missing.

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:34.810
No trace since?

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:36.540
You mean

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:39.050
Xie Buxie defected?

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:40.980
I dare not say that.

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:42.540
In Blood River,

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:45.170
there is no "missing".

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:47.460
If he left without leave,

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:48.730
that is desertion!

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:50.540
Send two men to find him.

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:51.610
Also,

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:54.930
send word to Xie Qidao

00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:56.580
to come

00:04:57.310 --> 00:04:58.250
to Jiuxiao City.

00:04:59.070 --> 00:04:59.730
Regarding Uncle Qidao...

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:02.220
I visited him before,

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:02.850
but...

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:04.250
he drove me out.

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:09.020
Everything has a price.

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:11.460
If he wants to shield

00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:12.380
his disciple,

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:15.330
he will pay for it!

00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:18.080
Blood River

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:19.730
is not some martial sect.

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:23.100
He doesn't get to shut in and train!

00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:24.640
And now...

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:29.220
Who allowed you to stand?

00:05:32.630 --> 00:05:33.460
On your knees.

00:05:34.510 --> 00:05:35.730
Kneel three days straight!

00:05:50.190 --> 00:05:50.810
Sir.

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:11.780
Who killed him?

00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:14.580
The Su family.

00:06:15.870 --> 00:06:16.290
Su Zhe.

00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:20.070
His gold ring

00:06:20.630 --> 00:06:22.400
would cause wounds like this.

00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:25.050
The Su family

00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:27.500
actually sent that monster.

00:06:32.870 --> 00:06:33.700
They all stand

00:06:33.720 --> 00:06:34.790
with the Patriarch?

00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:36.610
Likely not.

00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:39.260
He showed up

00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:40.640
to kill the miracle physician

00:06:40.640 --> 00:06:41.520
of Medicine King Valley,

00:06:41.690 --> 00:06:42.800
but for some reason

00:06:43.240 --> 00:06:44.490
he suddenly killed our men.

00:06:45.560 --> 00:06:46.410
I fought with my life

00:06:46.870 --> 00:06:47.980
to bring back the young master's body.

00:06:53.750 --> 00:06:54.460
Rise, all of you.

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:57.490
In Blood River, we live on the edge.

00:06:57.510 --> 00:06:58.370
That's the way of things.

00:06:59.310 --> 00:07:00.900
Even if the dead is my son,

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:03.460
you need not mourn!

00:07:10.390 --> 00:07:10.930
Who's coming?

00:07:16.830 --> 00:07:17.490
The Death Coffin?

00:07:18.120 --> 00:07:19.140
Locked inside The Death Coffin

00:07:19.680 --> 00:07:20.460
is that madman.

00:07:21.950 --> 00:07:22.340
Sir,

00:07:22.630 --> 00:07:23.610
you must not open this coffin.

00:07:23.750 --> 00:07:24.370
It's far too dangerous!

00:07:25.040 --> 00:07:25.610
The Death Coffin

00:07:26.040 --> 00:07:27.100
has been under the watch of the Soul Reapers' Hall.

00:07:27.720 --> 00:07:29.540
Why is it here?

00:07:29.950 --> 00:07:31.410
I requested it from the Soul Reapers' Hall.

00:07:32.800 --> 00:07:33.810
Since they agreed to lend it,

00:07:34.510 --> 00:07:35.850
it shows their loyalty lies

00:07:36.310 --> 00:07:37.460
with our Mu family.

00:08:00.800 --> 00:08:02.290
Ah, Changhe...

00:08:03.160 --> 00:08:05.490
either you don't act at all,

00:08:05.870 --> 00:08:06.540
or when you do,

00:08:07.430 --> 00:08:10.660
you plunge Blood River into chaos.

00:08:13.270 --> 00:08:13.980
Master,

00:08:14.560 --> 00:08:15.900
stop mocking me.

00:08:17.070 --> 00:08:18.060
Look at me.

00:08:18.060 --> 00:08:19.300
Mu Zizhe beat me to a pulp.

00:08:20.560 --> 00:08:22.100
I'm not as tough as you claim.

00:08:23.240 --> 00:08:24.850
Xie Fanhua is dead,

00:08:25.430 --> 00:08:27.140
you know that, right?

00:08:29.950 --> 00:08:30.780
I killed him.

00:08:31.360 --> 00:08:32.460
That guy

00:08:32.550 --> 00:08:33.100
was already

00:08:33.120 --> 00:08:34.010
half dead anyway.

00:08:34.480 --> 00:08:35.340
The Xie family

00:08:35.440 --> 00:08:36.870
had long wished him dead.

00:08:37.480 --> 00:08:38.180
Without his death,

00:08:38.550 --> 00:08:39.360
those younger ones

00:08:39.360 --> 00:08:40.400
couldn't step into view.

00:08:41.630 --> 00:08:44.010
If Xie Fanhua were healthy,

00:08:44.750 --> 00:08:45.890
there's no doubt

00:08:46.480 --> 00:08:49.370
he'd be the Xie family's next head.

00:08:50.390 --> 00:08:51.490
You killed him,

00:08:51.960 --> 00:08:54.010
that's on your record.

00:08:55.790 --> 00:08:56.850
But killing Mu Bai...

00:08:58.030 --> 00:08:59.490
you went too far.

00:09:00.630 --> 00:09:01.100
What?

00:09:02.030 --> 00:09:02.980
Mu Bai is dead too?

00:09:04.200 --> 00:09:05.020
Who did it?

00:09:07.910 --> 00:09:09.010
You don't know?

00:09:10.840 --> 00:09:11.700
Su Zhe.

00:09:12.150 --> 00:09:13.180
Who sent him?

00:09:17.200 --> 00:09:17.850
We're doomed.

00:09:18.870 --> 00:09:20.220
Uncle Zhe's usually

00:09:20.240 --> 00:09:21.650
the laziest of us,

00:09:22.480 --> 00:09:23.770
why so eager this time?

00:09:24.790 --> 00:09:25.650
Since he killed Mu Bai,

00:09:25.670 --> 00:09:26.910
if I run into Mu Zizhe again,

00:09:28.030 --> 00:09:29.310
he'll skin me alive!

00:09:29.840 --> 00:09:31.920
Mu Zizhe is a madman.

00:09:32.670 --> 00:09:34.740
Now you've killed his son,

00:09:34.910 --> 00:09:36.640
he won't just skin you,

00:09:36.720 --> 00:09:37.690
he'll skin

00:09:37.690 --> 00:09:39.740
the whole Su family.

00:09:40.960 --> 00:09:42.490
For the past hundred years,

00:09:43.630 --> 00:09:45.530
Blood River had its infighting.

00:09:46.080 --> 00:09:48.300
But the standoff among the Three Families

00:09:48.960 --> 00:09:50.130
never changed.

00:09:52.550 --> 00:09:53.730
This time

00:09:54.910 --> 00:09:56.890
may be different.

00:10:02.320 --> 00:10:02.850
Master,

00:10:03.440 --> 00:10:04.460
this really isn't on me.

00:10:04.480 --> 00:10:05.820
Uncle Zhe did it himself.

00:10:06.480 --> 00:10:07.060
I sent him to kill

00:10:07.080 --> 00:10:07.940
the miracle physician,

00:10:07.960 --> 00:10:08.820
not Mu Bai.

00:10:11.200 --> 00:10:12.100
Enough.

00:10:13.440 --> 00:10:15.010
What's done is done.

00:10:16.080 --> 00:10:17.250
Since that's the case,

00:10:18.670 --> 00:10:19.610
we may as well

00:10:20.480 --> 00:10:23.060
make all Blood River bear the name Su.

00:10:29.200 --> 00:10:30.370
Master, you're bold and brilliant.

00:10:31.320 --> 00:10:32.230
I, Su Changhe,

00:10:32.390 --> 00:10:33.510
will follow you to the death!

00:10:34.840 --> 00:10:36.800
You'll die for me,

00:10:37.440 --> 00:10:38.720
but what about Su Zhe?

00:10:46.750 --> 00:10:47.370
Uncle Zhe...

00:10:48.080 --> 00:10:48.610
what about him?

00:10:50.750 --> 00:10:52.130
Master feared Mu Zizhe's revenge,

00:10:52.670 --> 00:10:54.010
so he just sent a unit

00:10:54.010 --> 00:10:55.120
to reinforce Su Zhe.

00:10:55.480 --> 00:10:56.530
But they found

00:10:56.910 --> 00:10:58.690
Su Zhe didn't fight Su Muyu,

00:10:59.270 --> 00:11:00.560
instead he chose to travel with Su Muyu

00:11:00.600 --> 00:11:02.340
and that miracle physician

00:11:02.630 --> 00:11:03.420
back to the Spider's Nest.

00:11:12.910 --> 00:11:14.220
So Su Muyu turned Uncle Zhe

00:11:15.550 --> 00:11:16.490
to his side?

00:11:24.080 --> 00:11:24.490
Master.

00:11:26.390 --> 00:11:27.220
Just now...

00:11:28.080 --> 00:11:28.730
Buxie came back.

00:11:29.820 --> 00:11:33.420
[Xie Qidao of the Xie family]

00:11:34.270 --> 00:11:35.010
He's back?

00:11:39.030 --> 00:11:39.980
The task is done?

00:11:41.030 --> 00:11:42.220
He said nothing about it,

00:11:43.440 --> 00:11:44.370
just left this.

00:11:55.910 --> 00:11:58.060
He fought Su Muyu.

00:11:59.910 --> 00:12:01.940
This is the eighth move he mastered?

00:12:02.640 --> 00:12:03.510
Buxie said

00:12:03.720 --> 00:12:05.250
this still isn't the true eighth move.

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:07.610
He needs a few more years to roam.

00:12:08.080 --> 00:12:09.340
He'll return once he finds the answer.

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:16.010
He's mad.

00:12:17.200 --> 00:12:18.420
In Blood River,

00:12:19.200 --> 00:12:20.810
if one goes roaming the martial world

00:12:21.550 --> 00:12:22.870
and stays out over ten days,

00:12:23.510 --> 00:12:25.280
the Soul Reapers' Hall's kill writ

00:12:25.280 --> 00:12:26.540
will be issued

00:12:26.540 --> 00:12:27.460
without hesitation.

00:12:28.440 --> 00:12:29.700
That's the second matter.

00:12:30.670 --> 00:12:31.420
We received a letter from the family head.

00:12:35.390 --> 00:12:36.490
What does it say?

00:12:37.440 --> 00:12:38.580
I can't bother reading

00:12:39.120 --> 00:12:39.730
their usual nonsense.

00:12:40.510 --> 00:12:41.700
Just tell me straight.

00:12:42.240 --> 00:12:42.890
The head says,

00:12:43.240 --> 00:12:44.370
Xie Buxie's ignored the mission

00:12:45.030 --> 00:12:45.820
and left Blood River without leave,

00:12:46.120 --> 00:12:46.730
a capital offense.

00:12:47.480 --> 00:12:48.850
But if you will come out

00:12:49.320 --> 00:12:50.060
to Jiuxiao City

00:12:50.240 --> 00:12:51.130
and aid the Xie family,

00:12:51.870 --> 00:12:53.060
they'll ask the Soul Reapers' Hall

00:12:53.360 --> 00:12:54.130
for a writ

00:12:54.840 --> 00:12:56.060
pardoning Xie Buxie.

00:13:00.510 --> 00:13:01.610
Xie Ba...

00:13:03.960 --> 00:13:06.820
is quite the schemer.

00:13:08.020 --> 00:13:11.940
[Luojiuxiao Inn]

00:13:16.480 --> 00:13:16.980
Medicine time.

00:13:19.080 --> 00:13:19.580
Feed me.

00:13:20.270 --> 00:13:20.610
Hey...

00:13:20.960 --> 00:13:21.490
What?

00:13:23.870 --> 00:13:25.650
Shouldn't you feed me

00:13:25.670 --> 00:13:26.180
after you hurt me?

00:13:27.030 --> 00:13:28.340
I'm not clinging to you for life anyway.

00:13:28.440 --> 00:13:29.340
Count yourself lucky.

00:14:00.390 --> 00:14:01.770
Such a thoughtful young lord.

00:14:03.630 --> 00:14:04.530
Stalling me with this trick

00:14:04.840 --> 00:14:05.820
isn't a good idea.

00:14:07.870 --> 00:14:09.100
Your wounds will heal,

00:14:09.790 --> 00:14:10.250
and I...

00:14:11.080 --> 00:14:12.460
will seek the Patriarch

00:14:13.390 --> 00:14:14.420
to avenge Second Master Tang.

00:14:26.150 --> 00:14:27.250
Bitter medicine.

00:14:29.200 --> 00:14:30.420
Then wait till I'm healed,

00:14:30.480 --> 00:14:31.100
and we'll talk.

00:14:31.960 --> 00:14:33.340
After all, a Xuanwu Guardian

00:14:33.870 --> 00:14:35.010
should pay his debt first,

00:14:35.390 --> 00:14:36.130
then seek revenge.

00:14:44.750 --> 00:14:45.250
Uncle Zhe.

00:14:49.870 --> 00:14:51.010
That noise you made yesterday

00:14:51.030 --> 00:14:52.220
was way too loud.

00:14:52.600 --> 00:14:53.460
I heard it all.

00:14:54.200 --> 00:14:55.700
Do you really want to be Patriarch?

00:14:57.550 --> 00:14:58.250
You think I'm fit for it?

00:14:58.790 --> 00:14:59.370
No.

00:15:00.910 --> 00:15:01.700
If my daughter

00:15:01.790 --> 00:15:02.650
takes a shine to you,

00:15:03.150 --> 00:15:03.850
absolutely not.

00:15:05.550 --> 00:15:06.700
If she doesn't,

00:15:07.270 --> 00:15:07.890
then maybe.

00:15:12.600 --> 00:15:13.460
You jest, Uncle Zhe.

00:15:16.120 --> 00:15:17.460
News came from outside

00:15:18.390 --> 00:15:19.370
that Xie Fanhua is dead.

00:15:20.720 --> 00:15:21.580
Changhe killed him.

00:15:23.200 --> 00:15:24.130
Mu Bai is dead too.

00:15:25.120 --> 00:15:25.700
I killed him.

00:15:31.750 --> 00:15:33.340
Didn't Mu Bai already flee?

00:15:35.790 --> 00:15:36.610
So what do you think?

00:15:41.120 --> 00:15:41.890
Changhe was behind that.

00:15:43.270 --> 00:15:44.100
Mu Qingyang secretly joined

00:15:44.150 --> 00:15:45.370
Changhe's faction.

00:15:46.550 --> 00:15:47.580
And on Changhe's orders,

00:15:47.630 --> 00:15:48.370
he killed Mu Bai

00:15:49.870 --> 00:15:50.490
to frame you.

00:15:52.270 --> 00:15:53.220
That brat...

00:15:53.960 --> 00:15:54.940
He even schemes against me.

00:15:58.000 --> 00:15:59.730
He killed two young masters with one strike,

00:16:00.200 --> 00:16:01.300
seeming to cripple two families,

00:16:02.510 --> 00:16:04.460
but really dumping the blame on the Su family.

00:16:05.840 --> 00:16:07.010
This Blood River chaos

00:16:07.960 --> 00:16:08.770
has shifted

00:16:08.790 --> 00:16:10.130
from Three Families racing to kill the Patriarch

00:16:10.480 --> 00:16:11.460
and seize the Dormant Dragon Sword

00:16:12.030 --> 00:16:13.370
into a full-blown free-for-all.

00:16:15.320 --> 00:16:16.580
The greatest gains

00:16:17.390 --> 00:16:17.770
often come

00:16:17.840 --> 00:16:19.220
from the greatest chaos.

00:16:20.510 --> 00:16:21.460
Changhe's game

00:16:22.910 --> 00:16:24.060
has reached its endgame.

00:16:27.320 --> 00:16:28.770
I should've guessed

00:16:29.480 --> 00:16:30.250
he wasn't helping

00:16:30.270 --> 00:16:31.490
the Su family.

00:16:32.270 --> 00:16:33.770
He wanted the Dormant Dragon Sword himself.

00:16:34.480 --> 00:16:35.820
But even with the sword in hand,

00:16:35.840 --> 00:16:36.820
it's not over.

00:16:38.120 --> 00:16:39.300
Things were never as simple

00:16:39.320 --> 00:16:40.420
as Changhe thought.

00:16:44.080 --> 00:16:45.100
Looks like

00:16:45.670 --> 00:16:47.130
you have a plan of your own.

00:17:16.070 --> 00:17:17.940
The poison's nearly cleared.

00:17:19.680 --> 00:17:21.530
Has the young miracle physician returned?

00:17:37.720 --> 00:17:38.730
Long time no see,

00:17:39.790 --> 00:17:40.460
Sir.

00:17:42.510 --> 00:17:43.330
Zhe?

00:17:49.110 --> 00:17:50.010
Why did you

00:17:50.030 --> 00:17:51.050
suddenly show up here?

00:17:51.440 --> 00:17:53.090
Did that brat Su Jinhui

00:17:53.440 --> 00:17:54.940
send you to kill me?

00:18:00.200 --> 00:18:01.240
Years ago,

00:18:01.680 --> 00:18:03.200
I once risked my life

00:18:03.680 --> 00:18:04.860
for you.

00:18:06.270 --> 00:18:07.620
Now we meet again,

00:18:08.070 --> 00:18:08.940
Sir,

00:18:09.440 --> 00:18:10.190
you actually think

00:18:10.190 --> 00:18:11.460
I came to kill you?

00:18:14.790 --> 00:18:16.250
That stings.

00:18:19.200 --> 00:18:20.330
Isn't it so?

00:18:22.310 --> 00:18:23.090
It was, at first,

00:18:24.030 --> 00:18:25.050
but my daughter said

00:18:25.920 --> 00:18:26.660
if we took the fee,

00:18:27.440 --> 00:18:28.330
we must cure you.

00:18:29.160 --> 00:18:30.180
I listened to her.

00:18:32.110 --> 00:18:32.980
Your daughter?

00:18:38.790 --> 00:18:40.380
The Wen family of Medicine King Valley...

00:18:41.510 --> 00:18:42.700
No wonder.

00:18:44.240 --> 00:18:44.770
So,

00:18:45.110 --> 00:18:46.460
I should thank you, Sir.

00:18:47.200 --> 00:18:48.420
If not for that business with you,

00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:49.860
I'd have had no way

00:18:49.880 --> 00:18:51.180
to reunite with my girl.

00:19:05.200 --> 00:19:06.090
Miracle physician indeed.

00:19:09.480 --> 00:19:10.290
Yes.

00:19:10.720 --> 00:19:11.380
Your poison

00:19:11.590 --> 00:19:12.620
is mostly cleared.

00:19:13.270 --> 00:19:13.860
But remember:

00:19:14.200 --> 00:19:15.010
for the next few days,

00:19:15.310 --> 00:19:16.700
don't use inner force at will,

00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:18.860
or all is wasted.

00:19:21.030 --> 00:19:23.220
So you used Soul-Swap Technique

00:19:23.480 --> 00:19:24.730
to probe my memory

00:19:25.480 --> 00:19:27.610
to seek your father.

00:19:28.720 --> 00:19:30.380
And to cure your poison, too!

00:19:31.350 --> 00:19:32.770
I didn't lie to you.

00:19:33.480 --> 00:19:33.860
Look,

00:19:34.270 --> 00:19:35.250
you're back

00:19:35.270 --> 00:19:35.940
to being healthy.

00:19:37.310 --> 00:19:40.050
About the fee we agreed on,

00:19:40.310 --> 00:19:41.460
shouldn't we settle that?

00:19:44.120 --> 00:19:45.330
Everything I promised

00:19:45.350 --> 00:19:46.260
will be paid in full.

00:19:46.830 --> 00:19:48.140
I'm just curious,

00:19:48.880 --> 00:19:49.720
miracle physician,

00:19:50.030 --> 00:19:51.380
how did you cure me?

00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:53.490
I used Soul-Swap Technique

00:19:53.960 --> 00:19:56.010
to share your senses,

00:19:56.550 --> 00:19:57.980
so I also tasted

00:19:58.200 --> 00:19:59.490
that poison's agony

00:19:59.490 --> 00:20:00.770
throughout your body.

00:20:01.550 --> 00:20:02.770
But in the process,

00:20:03.550 --> 00:20:04.220
I found

00:20:04.750 --> 00:20:06.380
among the body's 720 points,

00:20:06.680 --> 00:20:07.330
one point

00:20:07.720 --> 00:20:09.900
untouched by that poison.

00:20:10.510 --> 00:20:11.730
That's the Zhiyang point.

00:20:12.350 --> 00:20:13.380
So I used a silver needle

00:20:13.790 --> 00:20:15.420
to herd the poison

00:20:15.750 --> 00:20:16.810
and drive it all

00:20:16.880 --> 00:20:17.810
into Zhiyang.

00:20:19.640 --> 00:20:21.090
Then you set one more needle

00:20:21.750 --> 00:20:23.220
to vent the toxins out?

00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:25.810
"Vented them out"?

00:20:26.310 --> 00:20:27.180
Not that simple.

00:20:28.240 --> 00:20:28.730
This poison

00:20:28.880 --> 00:20:30.810
should've been incurable.

00:20:31.400 --> 00:20:32.420
Only one way:

00:20:33.200 --> 00:20:35.090
life for life.

00:20:44.240 --> 00:20:45.860
Life for life?

00:20:47.400 --> 00:20:48.700
You need someone

00:20:48.790 --> 00:20:50.140
with superb inner force

00:20:50.440 --> 00:20:52.050
to cover Zhiyang with a palm

00:20:52.310 --> 00:20:54.140
and draw the poison out.

00:20:54.680 --> 00:20:55.860
That means

00:20:56.000 --> 00:20:57.940
taking it into himself.

00:20:58.640 --> 00:20:59.810
Then here's the question:

00:21:00.830 --> 00:21:02.010
in this Spider's Nest,

00:21:02.590 --> 00:21:04.090
who would trade a life

00:21:04.590 --> 00:21:06.090
for you, Sir?

00:21:19.790 --> 00:21:20.660
It was Kewen.

00:21:22.480 --> 00:21:23.180
I still remember

00:21:23.440 --> 00:21:25.250
the day we entered the Spider's Nest together.

00:21:26.070 --> 00:21:26.810
Back then,

00:21:27.240 --> 00:21:28.660
you could barely stand.

00:21:29.400 --> 00:21:30.570
Yet before him,

00:21:30.750 --> 00:21:32.420
you kept a steady front,

00:21:32.960 --> 00:21:35.530
never lowering your guard.

00:21:36.510 --> 00:21:37.530
But that very man

00:21:37.680 --> 00:21:38.860
before whom you refused

00:21:38.920 --> 00:21:40.530
to drop your guard,

00:21:41.110 --> 00:21:41.810
he gave up

00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:43.010
his life for you

00:21:43.070 --> 00:21:44.140
in the end.

00:21:45.310 --> 00:21:45.860
Sir,

00:21:46.750 --> 00:21:47.680
what was there

00:21:48.310 --> 00:21:49.220
between you two?

00:21:55.240 --> 00:21:56.400
Simply put,

00:21:56.440 --> 00:21:58.290
they were once brothers who shared a bond.

00:21:58.750 --> 00:21:59.680
Later one became

00:21:59.720 --> 00:22:01.490
the almighty Patriarch,

00:22:01.830 --> 00:22:02.460
the other

00:22:03.310 --> 00:22:05.770
a hunchbacked, ugly gatekeeper.

00:22:07.110 --> 00:22:08.180
That's about it.

00:22:14.110 --> 00:22:15.490
Where is he now?

00:22:17.830 --> 00:22:18.570
He's gone.

00:22:22.030 --> 00:22:22.570
Uncle Arhat,

00:22:23.720 --> 00:22:24.660
you really won't wait

00:22:24.720 --> 00:22:25.380
for the Patriarch to wake?

00:22:30.590 --> 00:22:31.490
No.

00:22:32.680 --> 00:22:33.530
Even if he wakes,

00:22:34.640 --> 00:22:36.180
there's no need to meet again.

00:22:38.400 --> 00:22:40.090
What lay between us

00:22:40.960 --> 00:22:41.900
is wiped clean

00:22:42.680 --> 00:22:44.010
from this moment.

00:22:48.830 --> 00:22:49.940
As for this Spider's Nest,

00:22:52.270 --> 00:22:53.810
handle it as you see fit.

00:22:56.590 --> 00:22:57.770
If the Patriarch is fine,

00:22:59.200 --> 00:23:00.180
then this Spider's Nest

00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:03.220
should now belong to Medicine King Valley.

00:23:06.720 --> 00:23:07.290
Very well.

00:23:08.720 --> 00:23:09.900
That young miracle physician

00:23:10.400 --> 00:23:12.090
is a fine girl.

00:23:15.590 --> 00:23:16.810
Never thought

00:23:16.880 --> 00:23:17.900
you would tease others.

00:23:20.110 --> 00:23:21.900
Only at the brink of death

00:23:22.510 --> 00:23:24.810
do people truly see themselves

00:23:25.590 --> 00:23:27.900
and win their freedom.

00:23:29.590 --> 00:23:30.220
Now,

00:23:31.270 --> 00:23:32.980
I'm no longer of Blood River,

00:23:34.200 --> 00:23:36.250
nor Mu Kewen of the Mu family,

00:23:37.400 --> 00:23:38.460
nor the keeper

00:23:40.270 --> 00:23:42.620
of this Spider's Nest.

00:23:48.110 --> 00:23:49.420
Without these burdens,

00:23:50.830 --> 00:23:51.680
I suddenly feel

00:23:51.720 --> 00:23:53.100
living in this world

00:23:53.960 --> 00:23:54.490
seems to have

00:23:55.400 --> 00:23:57.090
a bit more flavor.

00:23:58.550 --> 00:23:59.620
And I no longer

00:24:01.110 --> 00:24:02.220
wish so much to die.

00:24:06.110 --> 00:24:06.700
Uncle Arhat...

00:24:10.880 --> 00:24:11.950
I've heard

00:24:12.350 --> 00:24:13.920
your story with Su Changhe.

00:24:15.030 --> 00:24:16.380
You're much like

00:24:16.720 --> 00:24:18.330
me and Mingce in our youth.

00:24:20.750 --> 00:24:21.860
Oh, Mu Mingce

00:24:22.550 --> 00:24:25.250
was the Patriarch's name back then.

00:24:27.750 --> 00:24:28.570
I hope

00:24:29.400 --> 00:24:31.220
the ending between you two

00:24:31.920 --> 00:24:33.140
can be different

00:24:34.550 --> 00:24:35.460
from ours.

00:25:11.350 --> 00:25:11.940
He said

00:25:12.270 --> 00:25:12.860
what he owed you

00:25:13.070 --> 00:25:14.420
is paid this time.

00:25:15.640 --> 00:25:16.660
And what you owe him...

00:25:17.590 --> 00:25:18.900
leave it to the next life.

00:25:21.590 --> 00:25:23.570
For the rest of his days,

00:25:23.920 --> 00:25:24.860
he won't be Mu Kewen,

00:25:25.830 --> 00:25:26.940
nor belong to Blood River.

00:25:28.550 --> 00:25:29.380
No more meetings.

00:25:33.070 --> 00:25:34.940
He's drawn almost all the toxins

00:25:35.310 --> 00:25:36.660
from your body,

00:25:37.200 --> 00:25:38.250
but traces remain.

00:25:39.270 --> 00:25:40.860
I'll clear it with acupuncture

00:25:41.110 --> 00:25:42.180
over the next few days.

00:25:43.030 --> 00:25:43.900
But remember:

00:25:44.750 --> 00:25:45.430
for these days,

00:25:45.430 --> 00:25:46.930
do not stir your inner force,

00:25:47.240 --> 00:25:48.220
or it may return.

00:25:50.830 --> 00:25:51.420
So,

00:25:52.160 --> 00:25:53.220
does what comes next

00:25:53.920 --> 00:25:55.530
have nothing to do with us?

00:25:56.440 --> 00:25:57.660
Then please, Sir,

00:25:58.000 --> 00:25:59.290
write the Soul Reapers' Hall.

00:26:00.240 --> 00:26:01.020
I'm leaving.

00:26:01.590 --> 00:26:03.190
Tell them not to send killers after me.

00:26:11.200 --> 00:26:12.770
I gave you a chance,

00:26:13.960 --> 00:26:15.600
but you stayed.

00:26:16.440 --> 00:26:17.770
Some choices

00:26:19.160 --> 00:26:21.090
don't allow regret.

00:26:27.480 --> 00:26:28.290
Do not misuse your inner force.

00:26:36.880 --> 00:26:37.330
Uncle Zhe,

00:26:38.030 --> 00:26:39.250
let me speak with the Patriarch

00:26:39.310 --> 00:26:39.940
before we decide.

00:26:42.960 --> 00:26:43.660
You're right.

00:26:44.510 --> 00:26:45.100
Go talk first.

00:26:46.160 --> 00:26:47.260
If talk fails,

00:26:48.070 --> 00:26:49.220
I'll collect your body.

00:26:51.270 --> 00:26:52.430
Uncle Zhe, I hope

00:26:52.430 --> 00:26:53.580
you won't have to.

00:27:20.030 --> 00:27:21.070
The miracle physician

00:27:21.270 --> 00:27:22.700
has cleared my poison.

00:27:24.640 --> 00:27:25.180
Muyu,

00:27:26.110 --> 00:27:26.830
you fulfilled

00:27:26.830 --> 00:27:28.490
your own promise.

00:27:30.070 --> 00:27:31.570
I'll grant you freedom.

00:27:32.550 --> 00:27:33.140
Come here.

00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:43.820
Back then outside the Wailing Abyss,

00:27:44.200 --> 00:27:44.940
with one sword

00:27:44.960 --> 00:27:46.460
I planted the Life-Death Contract in you.

00:27:46.720 --> 00:27:47.980
The seven-year term nears.

00:27:48.480 --> 00:27:49.530
Only my inner force can dissolve it.

00:27:49.880 --> 00:27:51.490
That is our pact.

00:27:52.160 --> 00:27:52.770
Now,

00:27:53.830 --> 00:27:54.810
I'll purge it for you.

00:27:56.110 --> 00:27:56.980
No need, Sir.

00:27:58.200 --> 00:27:58.700
The poison

00:27:59.790 --> 00:28:00.980
was cured years ago.

00:28:03.070 --> 00:28:03.770
What?

00:28:05.440 --> 00:28:06.770
When I mastered the Eighteen-Sword Array,

00:28:07.400 --> 00:28:08.460
sword qi flooded my body

00:28:09.590 --> 00:28:10.570
and by chance that Life-Death Contract

00:28:10.590 --> 00:28:11.290
was dispelled.

00:28:17.590 --> 00:28:18.770
So that's it.

00:28:20.830 --> 00:28:22.020
I always thought

00:28:23.200 --> 00:28:25.290
you risked your life to guard me

00:28:26.550 --> 00:28:28.290
because of the shackle of the Life-Death Contract.

00:28:31.240 --> 00:28:32.700
You once saved my brother and me

00:28:32.750 --> 00:28:33.720
outside the Wailing Abyss.

00:28:34.440 --> 00:28:35.140
That kindness

00:28:35.880 --> 00:28:37.900
was worth my sword at your side.

00:28:39.030 --> 00:28:40.180
And the day I became a Kui,

00:28:41.440 --> 00:28:42.180
I swore with the Twelve Zodiacs

00:28:42.240 --> 00:28:43.290
an oath as well.

00:28:49.830 --> 00:28:50.770
Not by coercion,

00:28:52.480 --> 00:28:53.460
nor for profit,

00:28:56.920 --> 00:28:57.620
but for...

00:28:59.310 --> 00:29:00.900
loyalty and duty.

00:29:02.480 --> 00:29:03.220
I believe

00:29:04.480 --> 00:29:06.050
that's simply how it should be.

00:29:13.750 --> 00:29:14.380
Thank you.

00:29:16.720 --> 00:29:17.530
Just doing my duty.

00:29:23.510 --> 00:29:25.220
Don't say that again.

00:29:29.070 --> 00:29:29.730
I prefer

00:29:29.750 --> 00:29:31.660
the word earlier:

00:29:32.200 --> 00:29:32.980
loyalty.

00:29:37.550 --> 00:29:38.940
Blood River's Furnace

00:29:39.440 --> 00:29:40.900
can't teach that word.

00:29:42.790 --> 00:29:44.010
My father taught me that.

00:29:47.310 --> 00:29:49.090
The Sword God Zhuo Yuluo!

00:29:50.720 --> 00:29:52.380
He truly was remarkable.

00:29:55.350 --> 00:29:56.220
I always remember

00:29:57.350 --> 00:29:59.090
what he told me:

00:30:00.640 --> 00:30:01.770
in this world,

00:30:02.960 --> 00:30:04.530
honor bonds and keep your word.

00:30:07.350 --> 00:30:08.050
Forget either,

00:30:09.350 --> 00:30:10.980
and you lose the right to wield a sword.

00:30:12.400 --> 00:30:14.330
Honor bonds, keep your word...

00:30:18.590 --> 00:30:19.770
Just for those words,

00:30:22.640 --> 00:30:23.940
you will guard me to the death,

00:30:24.070 --> 00:30:25.330
at any cost?

00:30:27.030 --> 00:30:28.010

00:34:14.020 --> 00:34:16.050
You can negotiate without talking.

00:34:16.590 --> 00:34:18.380
We Su folk negotiate

00:34:19.070 --> 00:34:20.130
by the sword.

00:34:23.460 --> 00:34:26.220
[Sword Qi Soars]

00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:33.130
I've waited long for you,

00:34:33.510 --> 00:34:34.570
Su Muyu!

00:34:35.110 --> 00:34:36.010
I'm here for the master.

00:34:38.320 --> 00:34:38.860
Halt!

00:34:41.280 --> 00:34:42.010
Su Muyu,

00:34:42.550 --> 00:34:44.170
let me test your sword.

00:34:45.320 --> 00:34:46.050
Su Ze

00:34:47.030 --> 00:34:48.010
facing Su Muyu?

00:34:56.760 --> 00:34:57.900
Tricks and trifles.

00:34:58.360 --> 00:34:59.050
Better use

00:34:59.070 --> 00:35:00.210
your Eighteen-Sword Array.

00:35:00.960 --> 00:35:02.010
You want to see my sword?

00:35:02.590 --> 00:35:03.420
I want to see

00:35:03.880 --> 00:35:05.380
who is the strongest swordsman

00:35:05.670 --> 00:35:07.010
of this Su generation.

00:35:07.320 --> 00:35:08.690
Why is the Su family's top swordsman

00:35:08.710 --> 00:35:09.530
one of them?

00:35:09.920 --> 00:35:11.010
Did Su Ze crown himself?

00:35:11.670 --> 00:35:12.650
You use daggers.

00:35:13.150 --> 00:35:14.090
If you take a sword,

00:35:14.670 --> 00:35:15.610
I'll look forward

00:35:15.670 --> 00:35:16.610
to that instant

00:35:17.110 --> 00:35:17.860
you draw,

00:35:18.480 --> 00:35:19.940
to your blade's light.

00:35:21.550 --> 00:35:22.130
Let's make a bet.

00:35:23.070 --> 00:35:24.650
How many moves before Su Ze's down?

00:35:25.670 --> 00:35:26.940
Ze is still too young.

00:35:28.670 --> 00:35:30.340
Within five moves, I'd say.
