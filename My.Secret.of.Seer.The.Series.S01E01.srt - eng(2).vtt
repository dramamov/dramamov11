In this world,
there are hundreds of kinds of scent.

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:51.480
My name is Win Wongsawat,

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:53.280
and I can "smell" spiritual energy.

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:57.480
Well, actually,
I can smell all the scents in this world.

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:00.720
I was born with
a hypersensitive sense of smell,

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:03.280
whether they are physical scents

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:04.520
like food,

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:05.560
desserts,

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:06.760
detergents,

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:07.800
perfumes,

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:08.880
and flowers,

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:10.520
or intangible ones

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:12.000
like virtue,

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:13.040
evil,

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:14.240
love,

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:15.360
greed,

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:16.360
wrath,

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:17.400
and obsession,

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:19.840
each with its own distinct scent.

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:22.080
And lastly, there's spiritual energy.

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:45.480
Hello?

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:47.000
Hey, Win!

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:49.720
Wait there at the restaurant.

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:53.320
Something happened to
your fortune-telling client.

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:54.960
I'm picking them up right now.

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:57.040
Sure. Hurry, then.

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:58.720
I'm sleepy and it's cold.

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:02.080
The A/C here is freezing me to death.

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:06.760
Okay, okay.

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:35.400
- One iced Americano, please.
- Yes, just a moment.

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:55.000
Whose jacket is this?

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:18.160
The scent of summer?

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:26.520

Sometimes I can't tell
if this is reality, a dreamâ€¦

00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:57.400
or some other world.

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:14.680
Who's there?!

00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:50.760
Please...

00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:00.280
Are you ready?

00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:01.560
Are you ready?!

00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:06.400
This dream again.

00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:42.560
Venerable Father,

00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:44.600
this batch looks smaller than usual.

00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:47.720
Win.

00:06:48.640 --> 00:06:51.160
Your bad luck year can be fatal.

00:06:55.480 --> 00:06:56.920
From now on,

00:06:56.960 --> 00:06:59.240
you'll encounter many inexplicable events.

00:07:09.880 --> 00:07:10.880
Here.

00:07:12.600 --> 00:07:13.720
Thank you, Venerable Father.

00:07:18.680 --> 00:07:19.680
But...

00:07:20.680 --> 00:07:23.160
I already know these kinds of things.

00:07:24.320 --> 00:07:25.600
It won't suffice.

00:07:26.766 --> 00:07:30.086
But why do they want to take my life?

00:07:30.840 --> 00:07:31.920
That I do not know.

00:07:32.400 --> 00:07:35.600
But a highly virtuous individual is your refuge.

00:07:37.200 --> 00:07:39.040
A highly virtuous individual?

00:07:39.440 --> 00:07:40.680
Who is it?

00:07:42.400 --> 00:07:45.760
You have a better sense of smell than I do.

00:07:46.280 --> 00:07:47.560
Use it.

00:07:48.040 --> 00:07:49.520
Use it to your advantage.

00:07:49.920 --> 00:07:52.520
That person will save you from demise.

00:07:54.120 --> 00:07:55.720
They should not be far from your reach.

00:07:56.800 --> 00:07:58.080
But the most important thing is,

00:07:58.640 --> 00:08:01.600
you must not travel out of the city at all.

00:08:09.280 --> 00:08:10.560

00:08:11.960 --> 00:08:14.520

Sadhu.

00:08:19.040 --> 00:08:20.040
Win, dude!

00:08:20.840 --> 00:08:22.120
- Win!
- You've got the keycard!

00:08:22.160 --> 00:08:23.480
Use it!

00:08:26.360 --> 00:08:28.120
Win! What the hell have you been doing?

00:08:28.160 --> 00:08:30.920
Your client, the heir of a gold shop,
is waiting for you!

00:08:31.640 --> 00:08:33.120
The session starts at 9:30 A.M., no?

00:08:33.320 --> 00:08:34.320
Look at the time.

00:08:34.360 --> 00:08:36.040
It's already 9:45!

00:08:36.320 --> 00:08:37.600
Shit!

00:08:37.640 --> 00:08:39.600
- Go. Now!
- I'm screwed!

00:09:01.080 --> 00:09:02.400
So how is it, Master?

00:09:03.160 --> 00:09:04.400
Why is it taking you so long?

00:09:05.040 --> 00:09:07.080
Well, it's...

00:09:08.560 --> 00:09:10.280
Well what? Just say it!

00:09:10.880 --> 00:09:12.320
I'm cool with whatever result.

00:09:12.640 --> 00:09:13.640
Well...

00:09:14.400 --> 00:09:17.960
Is it possible for you
to withdraw your shares right away?

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:19.280
This isn't your time.

00:09:19.520 --> 00:09:20.520
Huh?

00:09:21.200 --> 00:09:22.280
What do you mean?

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:24.160
Is it gonna be a loss?

00:09:24.560 --> 00:09:25.800
Or a profit?

00:09:27.880 --> 00:09:31.640
That's all I want to know.
Will I make a loss or a profit?

00:09:35.800 --> 00:09:37.120
I don't have many options, do I?

00:09:37.960 --> 00:09:39.320
That's all I want to find out.

00:09:41.320 --> 00:09:42.320
Come on.

00:09:43.520 --> 00:09:44.560
Stop wasting time.

00:09:46.160 --> 00:09:47.680
Do you even know how to read fortunes?

00:09:49.440 --> 00:09:50.960
I've got other things to do, you know?

00:09:53.200 --> 00:09:54.200
Please give me a moment.

00:10:11.800 --> 00:10:14.760
This scent...
He's certainly running on borrowed money.

00:10:16.840 --> 00:10:17.840
I think...

00:10:18.200 --> 00:10:19.520
Think what?

00:10:19.960 --> 00:10:20.760
It'll be catastrophic.

00:10:20.800 --> 00:10:21.800
You're definitely doomed.

00:10:22.600 --> 00:10:23.280
Hey!

00:10:23.440 --> 00:10:24.800
How is that possible?

00:10:25.120 --> 00:10:26.560
I've poured so much into it!

00:10:27.120 --> 00:10:29.080
I shouldn't have asked you for a reading.

00:10:29.120 --> 00:10:31.176
- This is unacceptable!
- Please wait a moment, Mr. King.

00:10:31.200 --> 00:10:33.480
Would you like to read
other aspects instead?

00:10:33.520 --> 00:10:35.320
Anything else you're still worried about?

00:10:35.360 --> 00:10:36.640
I only came for one thing.

00:10:36.920 --> 00:10:37.880
That's it. I've had enough.

00:10:37.920 --> 00:10:39.080
- Mr. King!
- Disappointing!

00:10:39.120 --> 00:10:40.136
- I'm not paying.
- Please wait!

00:10:40.160 --> 00:10:41.520
- Mr. King!
- Hey, Namo.

00:10:41.560 --> 00:10:42.640
Let him go.

00:10:50.880 --> 00:10:52.080
Come on, man.

00:10:52.600 --> 00:10:55.760
A client's satisfaction can go both ways.

00:10:57.440 --> 00:10:58.760
You're a bastard yourself.

00:10:59.320 --> 00:11:02.400
Only bringing me shady clients.

00:11:02.760 --> 00:11:05.080
What? How am I supposed to know?

00:11:05.280 --> 00:11:07.600
I don't have smelling senses like you!

00:11:08.960 --> 00:11:10.600
What do we do next?

00:11:11.120 --> 00:11:12.960
We don't have that many clients this month.

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:14.320
There are barely any, even.

00:11:14.920 --> 00:11:17.160
I've already dealt with old clients.

00:11:18.720 --> 00:11:22.280
I paid for ads and promoted the page,
but it got reported...

00:11:23.240 --> 00:11:24.480
What should we do?

00:11:28.080 --> 00:11:30.480
That's right. I'm Win Wongsawat.

00:11:30.520 --> 00:11:32.200
I can smell spiritual energy.

00:11:32.240 --> 00:11:33.960
Most of the time, it's just the scents.

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:35.600
But if it's strong, I can hear them too.

00:11:35.640 --> 00:11:38.920
When my mind is weak,
they show themselves in 8K Ultra HD.

00:11:50.120 --> 00:11:52.160
I can smell everything in this world.

00:11:52.960 --> 00:11:56.760
By everything, I really mean it.

00:11:57.320 --> 00:11:59.040
Including spiritual energy,

00:11:59.080 --> 00:12:01.320
which is unique to each spirit.

00:12:01.800 --> 00:12:04.160
However, all of these require interpretation.

00:12:04.200 --> 00:12:07.880
I myself haven't explored every scent, either.

00:12:55.280 --> 00:12:56.280
Shit!

00:12:56.800 --> 00:13:01.080
This always happened
at every workplace I was in.

00:13:01.280 --> 00:13:02.840
And I'd get scolded by my boss,

00:13:02.880 --> 00:13:04.120
have my salary cut,

00:13:04.160 --> 00:13:05.776
and become a gossip topic among colleagues.

00:13:05.800 --> 00:13:06.920
I'm sorry.

00:13:12.800 --> 00:13:15.000
I'm staying at Namo's father's condo,

00:13:15.040 --> 00:13:17.520
as I couldn't afford a roof over my head.

00:13:17.800 --> 00:13:20.400
Luckily, he's generous enough to let me stay

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:23.800
until I can afford my own place.

00:13:24.120 --> 00:13:27.760
I spent days and nights looking for work,

00:13:28.240 --> 00:13:33.720
until I realized that
I could make a living with fortune-telling.

00:13:34.400 --> 00:13:38.000
However, with this card...

00:13:38.280 --> 00:13:42.440
Guardian spirits and your karmic creditors
are coming for you

00:13:42.480 --> 00:13:45.680
to remind you to pray and make merit.

00:13:45.720 --> 00:13:47.440
They're waiting for your offerings.

00:13:47.480 --> 00:13:50.080
So this card means
you have to make merits ASAP!

00:13:50.120 --> 00:13:51.120
This is a warning.

00:13:51.160 --> 00:13:54.160
However, if you don't have the time to do so,
feel free to reach out to me.

00:13:54.280 --> 00:13:56.160
I have sacred blessings to help.

00:14:21.600 --> 00:14:22.600
Whoa...

00:14:23.200 --> 00:14:24.560
It's clear.

00:14:25.160 --> 00:14:26.480
Your partner is cheating on you.

00:14:26.640 --> 00:14:27.640
Are you serious?

00:14:29.080 --> 00:14:30.680
Just as I thought...

00:14:32.640 --> 00:14:34.080
What should I do, Namo?

00:14:36.280 --> 00:14:37.600
I don't know either.

00:14:37.640 --> 00:14:39.000
I also got dumped.

00:14:42.400 --> 00:14:46.480
This was when I realized
strange scents clouded them.

00:14:47.360 --> 00:14:49.560
I've been doing fortune-telling
since I was a sophomore.

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:51.840
That was when I learned about tarot cards.

00:14:52.560 --> 00:14:53.920
I taught myself everything.

00:14:56.440 --> 00:14:57.360
Win,

00:14:57.400 --> 00:14:58.720
your reading is spot on.

00:14:59.560 --> 00:15:01.480
But honestly, I already knew that somewhat.

00:15:01.520 --> 00:15:03.080
I'll put an end to this.

00:15:03.640 --> 00:15:05.520
Excellent. You're doing the right thing.

00:15:07.960 --> 00:15:09.240
This is heartbreaking.

00:15:12.040 --> 00:15:15.120
Back then, I studied fortune-telling
only to help out my friends.

00:15:15.400 --> 00:15:20.080
However, nobody knew that
I'd be making a living with this art.

00:15:29.520 --> 00:15:30.520
Right.

00:15:36.040 --> 00:15:37.360
Tong, the lighting's set.

00:15:37.400 --> 00:15:40.000
How is it?
His face doesn't look sickly, does it?

00:15:40.440 --> 00:15:41.440
Look at the camera, Win.

00:15:42.520 --> 00:15:44.080
Yeah. Good to go.

00:15:46.080 --> 00:15:47.320
- Alright.
- All set?

00:15:47.960 --> 00:15:48.840
Are you ready?

00:15:48.880 --> 00:15:49.880
Let's do this, Win!

00:15:51.280 --> 00:15:52.400
We're going live.

00:15:52.960 --> 00:15:54.960
Three, two, one.

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:00.040
Hello, everybody.

00:16:00.080 --> 00:16:02.000
I'm Master Win.

00:16:02.040 --> 00:16:06.080
Feel free to send me your questions.

00:16:18.400 --> 00:16:19.720
Hold on, Namo.

00:16:20.320 --> 00:16:22.040
Is this your solution to my problem?

00:16:22.560 --> 00:16:24.160
Fortune telling at a funeral?

00:16:25.680 --> 00:16:26.680
Listen.

00:16:26.920 --> 00:16:28.200
At least the food's free.

00:16:35.960 --> 00:16:37.760
(With Condolences: MP Eung Wiriya and Family)

00:16:40.680 --> 00:16:41.680
Win?

00:16:42.840 --> 00:16:44.680
Do you think this place is filled with ghosts?

00:16:47.280 --> 00:16:50.120
Just because you don't see them
doesn't mean they don't know

00:16:50.160 --> 00:16:51.560
you're disrespecting them!

00:16:51.840 --> 00:16:53.840
What? Come on!

00:16:54.960 --> 00:16:56.080
I'm leaving.

00:16:58.920 --> 00:17:01.440
Are you the fortune teller friend
of MP Eung's son?

00:17:02.080 --> 00:17:03.080
Yes.

00:17:03.760 --> 00:17:06.440
Can you please give me a reading?

00:17:09.280 --> 00:17:10.280
Sure.

00:17:10.360 --> 00:17:13.200
I'd like to know
if he's passed peacefully or not,

00:17:13.240 --> 00:17:14.840
if he still has worries to cling to.

00:17:15.560 --> 00:17:17.080
My son, Daeng...

00:17:28.760 --> 00:17:31.520
He said that if he had to die,

00:17:31.680 --> 00:17:33.320
he wanted to die in the line of duty.

00:17:33.720 --> 00:17:36.360
And look at what his words got him!

00:17:37.520 --> 00:17:41.240
But I've never done a reading for the dead...

00:17:42.560 --> 00:17:44.480
It can get confusing.

00:17:49.640 --> 00:17:52.560
Is this true?
He actually passed away happily?

00:17:53.600 --> 00:17:55.440
Thank you so much, Master.

00:17:55.720 --> 00:17:57.920
So, how much do you charge for this?

00:17:58.520 --> 00:18:00.600
You've already paid me.

00:18:01.080 --> 00:18:03.240
Huh? When?

00:18:04.240 --> 00:18:06.320
With the tasty food offered here.

00:18:07.280 --> 00:18:09.920
Goodness me!
How are you this adorable?

00:18:10.120 --> 00:18:13.000
If I won the lottery,
I'd never forget about you.

00:18:14.960 --> 00:18:16.120
So touching...

00:18:17.400 --> 00:18:18.416
This better be the last time.

00:18:18.440 --> 00:18:19.960
No more fortune-telling like this,

00:18:20.240 --> 00:18:21.480
especially at funerals!

00:18:39.760 --> 00:18:40.760
Here.

00:18:48.200 --> 00:18:49.200
Thank you.

00:18:54.240 --> 00:18:57.120
Why do I smell... summer?

00:18:57.160 --> 00:18:58.360
Where is it coming from?

00:18:59.400 --> 00:19:00.400
Oops!

00:19:13.520 --> 00:19:14.520
My apologies.

00:19:14.760 --> 00:19:16.280
Can I have some paper napkins, please?

00:19:20.800 --> 00:19:22.040
Let me clean it up for you.

00:19:28.720 --> 00:19:30.720
I can't sense what he's thinking.

00:19:31.640 --> 00:19:34.600
All I sense is the scent of summer.

00:19:37.720 --> 00:19:39.520
And the scent is very familiar.

00:19:43.800 --> 00:19:45.200
Who are you looking for?

00:19:50.800 --> 00:19:53.160
Don't be upset, Win.

00:19:53.680 --> 00:19:56.000
You still have many more clients waiting.

00:19:57.560 --> 00:19:58.840
It's not about that.

00:19:59.640 --> 00:20:01.040
What are you upset about, then?

00:20:01.920 --> 00:20:04.320
I've been having nightmares.

00:20:04.920 --> 00:20:07.480
And nothing but bad luck.

00:20:08.280 --> 00:20:09.760
Don't think that way.

00:20:10.320 --> 00:20:13.680
You have to manifest and affirm
that good things are coming.

00:20:15.080 --> 00:20:16.080
I'm exhausted.

00:20:16.960 --> 00:20:18.200
Come on.

00:20:18.920 --> 00:20:20.480
Come on, Win.

00:20:21.520 --> 00:20:23.760
My dad said you're a lovely person.

00:20:23.800 --> 00:20:25.520
You help others through fortune telling.

00:20:25.560 --> 00:20:27.440
The good karma will bring you luck. Trust me.

00:20:28.440 --> 00:20:30.000
That's nonsense.

00:20:30.520 --> 00:20:33.440
I've been doing this for two years now,
and I've had nothing but bad luck.

00:20:41.760 --> 00:20:42.760
What are you looking at?

00:20:43.200 --> 00:20:44.200
You look so stressed.

00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:48.000
Give me a sec, Wongsawat. It's serious.

00:20:49.760 --> 00:20:50.760
What's with him?

00:20:57.280 --> 00:20:58.280
Win.

00:20:58.880 --> 00:21:00.080
We need to talk.

00:21:00.720 --> 00:21:01.880
About what, exactly?

00:21:02.600 --> 00:21:04.800
Do you know the 'Spooky Hellish Night' show?

00:21:04.840 --> 00:21:07.240
The dance show you're hooked on?

00:21:07.280 --> 00:21:09.560
No, it's not that!

00:21:09.600 --> 00:21:12.480
Spooky Hellish Night is popular as hell!

00:21:12.520 --> 00:21:14.240
Their videos all hit a million views!

00:21:15.080 --> 00:21:16.400
Tong, have you heard of it?

00:21:16.440 --> 00:21:17.800
It's a show about spooky stories.

00:21:24.960 --> 00:21:28.320
So you saw a ghost?

00:21:28.360 --> 00:21:29.560
Then what happened?

00:21:29.600 --> 00:21:31.440
It's been tormenting you?

00:21:31.480 --> 00:21:33.840
That night, I was heading home.

00:21:33.880 --> 00:21:35.880
I felt like I was being followed.

00:21:35.920 --> 00:21:37.000
Gosh...

00:21:37.520 --> 00:21:41.640
What made you believe
that a ghost was following you?

00:21:41.800 --> 00:21:43.080
I heard a noise.

00:21:43.120 --> 00:21:44.440
- A noise?
- Yes.

00:21:44.480 --> 00:21:45.560
Oh!

00:21:45.920 --> 00:21:46.920
'Spooky Hellish Night, '

00:21:47.160 --> 00:21:49.400
a ghost story show on YouTube.

00:21:49.760 --> 00:21:51.320
It's the talk of the town right now.

00:21:51.640 --> 00:21:54.920
Phloengnathitorn is the host.

00:21:55.920 --> 00:21:57.680
He's both handsome and scary.

00:21:58.280 --> 00:21:59.800
Each night I watch him,

00:21:59.840 --> 00:22:01.440
I can't help but get my heart racing.

00:22:02.560 --> 00:22:03.680
Phloeng... what?

00:22:04.640 --> 00:22:05.640
Gosh...

00:22:06.400 --> 00:22:08.480
Whatever. So what about it?

00:22:09.480 --> 00:22:12.000
You guys know I hate ghost stories.

00:22:13.320 --> 00:22:16.160
They sent an invite to be on the show!

00:22:16.720 --> 00:22:19.480
Whoa! Congrats, Namo!

00:22:19.720 --> 00:22:20.720
Are they paying too?

00:22:20.760 --> 00:22:21.760
Of course!

00:22:22.040 --> 00:22:24.800
Plus, they only want
the cream of the crop, you know?

00:22:24.840 --> 00:22:28.280
No good profile, no spooky story,
no chance you'll be invited!

00:22:29.640 --> 00:22:32.160
Whoa! My good friend's getting famous!

00:22:32.200 --> 00:22:34.000
What? But the invited guest isn't me!

00:22:35.400 --> 00:22:36.400
Is it Tong?

00:22:36.720 --> 00:22:37.720
Seriously?

00:22:38.120 --> 00:22:39.400
Did you submit my profile?

00:22:39.880 --> 00:22:40.880
Whoa!

00:22:41.280 --> 00:22:42.600
Not you!

00:22:43.120 --> 00:22:45.240
Win, they invited you!

00:22:45.840 --> 00:22:46.840
- Me?
- Yeah!

00:22:48.120 --> 00:22:49.560
I submitted your profile to them.

00:22:49.600 --> 00:22:53.080
I wrote,
"The White Knight Seer with his Spooky Tales."

00:22:53.320 --> 00:22:55.560
They said they want you
on the show tomorrow!

00:22:56.200 --> 00:22:58.680
It'll be the first time 'Spooky Hellish Night'

00:22:58.880 --> 00:23:01.000
has a fortune teller as a guest!

00:23:02.120 --> 00:23:03.160
Shit!

00:23:03.920 --> 00:23:04.920
Whoa...

00:23:05.640 --> 00:23:07.840
You must be over the moon right now.

00:23:08.760 --> 00:23:09.600
No.

00:23:09.640 --> 00:23:12.320
- You're shit, Namo.
- What the hell, dude?

00:23:12.360 --> 00:23:14.576
- You didn't tell me a damn thing about this!
- Listen first!

00:23:14.600 --> 00:23:15.600
Tong, help me!

00:23:15.640 --> 00:23:16.760
I got you work, damn it...

00:23:16.800 --> 00:23:18.440
- Tong, I told you to help me!
- Quiet!

00:23:18.840 --> 00:23:20.280
Just hear me out first.

00:23:20.320 --> 00:23:21.600
Stop fighting, guys.

00:23:21.800 --> 00:23:23.240
The pay is very high.

00:23:24.800 --> 00:23:26.776
Please go on the show.
I sent them your profile, man!

00:23:26.800 --> 00:23:28.200
Yeah, you should go.

00:23:29.080 --> 00:23:30.960
Help me convince him to go on the show.

00:23:32.360 --> 00:23:33.800
- It's 10 A.M. tomorrow.
- Please go.

00:23:34.400 --> 00:23:35.400
Just do it.

00:23:40.440 --> 00:23:41.760
What was he thinking?

00:23:41.800 --> 00:23:43.320
Dragged me onto that show for what?

00:23:43.360 --> 00:23:44.560
So damn annoying.

00:23:45.120 --> 00:23:46.640
Please don't be mad at him.

00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:48.600
He meant well.

00:23:48.960 --> 00:23:50.120
Seriously?

00:23:50.160 --> 00:23:52.040
Meaning well by signing me up
for the damn show?

00:23:53.360 --> 00:23:55.600
Are you really going to let this opportunity go?

00:23:56.720 --> 00:23:58.360
You're good with words, Tong.

00:23:59.440 --> 00:24:01.080
But you know that I'm afraid of ghosts.

00:24:01.800 --> 00:24:04.760
A show like that is definitely full of them.

00:24:05.480 --> 00:24:06.880
I know.

00:24:08.200 --> 00:24:09.720
But consider this.

00:24:10.400 --> 00:24:12.440
Each of your fortune-telling sessions

00:24:12.640 --> 00:24:14.200
takes two to three hours,

00:24:14.520 --> 00:24:16.200
and you only get paid 169 baht.

00:24:17.160 --> 00:24:19.120
But telling a story on the show
for a few minutes

00:24:19.520 --> 00:24:21.040
gets you 30,000 baht!

00:24:21.680 --> 00:24:23.440
To make that much from just fortune-telling,

00:24:23.720 --> 00:24:25.600
you'd have to shuffle cards
until you cramp up.

00:24:26.600 --> 00:24:28.040
Please think this through.

00:24:29.200 --> 00:24:30.320
Think carefully.

00:24:34.960 --> 00:24:36.720
That's 30,000 baht in your pocket!

00:24:40.360 --> 00:24:41.360
Please go on the show.

00:24:43.520 --> 00:24:44.880
What the hell are you saying?

00:24:45.480 --> 00:24:46.600
You heard me.

00:24:47.200 --> 00:24:49.080
And if it hits a million views,

00:24:49.360 --> 00:24:51.080
they'll pay an extra 70,000!

00:24:51.840 --> 00:24:53.160
That's 100,000 baht in total!

00:24:53.320 --> 00:24:55.240
- 100,000 baht?
- Yeah.

00:24:58.240 --> 00:24:59.440
So what's it going to be?

00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:02.120
Are you accepting the offer?

00:25:06.320 --> 00:25:07.320
Fine.

00:25:07.360 --> 00:25:08.800
- For real?
- I'll be on the show.

00:25:08.960 --> 00:25:10.360
- Yes!
- Tell Namo for me.

00:25:10.400 --> 00:25:12.200
Absolutely. I'll do it for you.

00:25:12.240 --> 00:25:13.880
You've made the right decision. Let's go!

00:25:19.800 --> 00:25:21.160
Sadhu.

00:25:21.960 --> 00:25:24.120
May this be a good night.

00:26:02.320 --> 00:26:03.320
Oops!

00:26:08.680 --> 00:26:09.680
Alright.

00:26:10.640 --> 00:26:12.640
For the sake of work, money,

00:26:13.160 --> 00:26:14.160
and my future.

00:26:46.320 --> 00:26:47.760
It's this dream again.

00:27:24.600 --> 00:27:26.200
You want it like this, huh?

00:27:53.280 --> 00:27:55.080
You're safe now, Win.

00:28:15.160 --> 00:28:16.280
Win.

00:28:18.640 --> 00:28:19.760
Win?

00:28:22.680 --> 00:28:23.680
Win!

00:28:54.640 --> 00:28:55.640
Win!

00:28:56.560 --> 00:28:57.880
Wake up! You're running late!

00:29:00.400 --> 00:29:01.240
Phloeng?

00:29:01.400 --> 00:29:02.400
Wake up, Win!

00:29:03.400 --> 00:29:04.520
What?!

00:29:04.840 --> 00:29:05.840
Tohmorn?

00:29:08.360 --> 00:29:10.520
Why are you naked?

00:29:11.800 --> 00:29:14.040
I told you not to
do mischievous things while I'm asleep!

00:29:14.480 --> 00:29:17.520
Or else I won't cook
your favorite dish as an offering.

00:29:18.760 --> 00:29:19.920
I'm really sorry.

00:29:19.960 --> 00:29:22.600
I just wanted to wake you up.

00:29:23.360 --> 00:29:24.560
You can do that,

00:29:24.880 --> 00:29:26.720
but not naked like this!

00:29:27.760 --> 00:29:30.520
Well, I got bored of
showing the other ghosts my goods.

00:29:30.560 --> 00:29:32.560
So this time, I want you to see them!

00:29:32.760 --> 00:29:35.120
I'm gonna let this pass for once.

00:29:35.360 --> 00:29:37.520
Next time, I'll use enchanted rice on you.

00:29:37.920 --> 00:29:40.240
Can you enchant us to fall in love, too?

00:29:41.120 --> 00:29:42.320
Sure.

00:29:48.560 --> 00:29:49.280
I'm...

00:29:49.320 --> 00:29:50.320
I'm sorry.

00:29:50.920 --> 00:29:53.440
People these days work too hard.

00:29:53.480 --> 00:29:55.720
Please don't push yourself too much.

00:29:55.760 --> 00:29:57.400
Take care of yourself, okay?

00:29:57.720 --> 00:29:59.280
Now that's easier on the ears.

00:29:59.680 --> 00:30:00.840
Just leave already.

00:30:01.240 --> 00:30:02.560
I need to take a shower.

00:30:03.480 --> 00:30:04.840
No peeking, okay?

00:30:05.480 --> 00:30:06.920
Oh, okay!

00:30:15.920 --> 00:30:16.920
Let's do this.

00:30:19.280 --> 00:30:20.280
Oh!

00:30:25.600 --> 00:30:26.840
Today is Monday.

00:30:27.520 --> 00:30:30.120
So the auspicious color that
makes the seniors adore me is...

00:31:30.280 --> 00:31:31.440
Whoa...

00:31:31.720 --> 00:31:34.280
It's not a brand-new company,

00:31:34.560 --> 00:31:36.800
but they've got a good location and orientation.

00:31:37.080 --> 00:31:39.640
And a lucky entrance attracting wealth.

00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:41.000
And not to mention...

00:31:41.040 --> 00:31:42.080
The scent here...

00:31:43.720 --> 00:31:45.400
Indian cork trees. A lot of them.

00:31:48.280 --> 00:31:49.480
Who's that?

00:31:55.600 --> 00:31:56.600
Good morning.

00:31:56.840 --> 00:31:57.840
What are you doing here?

00:31:58.920 --> 00:32:00.200
I'm here for a shoot.

00:32:01.320 --> 00:32:02.760
It's just the two of you here?

00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:06.680
Check in with the staff inside for a card, yeah?

00:32:10.520 --> 00:32:12.080
You scared me, Toh!

00:32:13.160 --> 00:32:14.160
Wow, Win...

00:32:14.480 --> 00:32:17.200
Are security guards these days
this good-looking?

00:32:19.560 --> 00:32:20.600
And?

00:32:23.200 --> 00:32:24.720
I'm afraid I can't go inside with you.

00:32:25.720 --> 00:32:27.440
The energy radiating from there is too hot.

00:32:27.480 --> 00:32:29.800
I'd be dead again if I were to enter!

00:32:33.240 --> 00:32:34.240
Well...

00:32:35.360 --> 00:32:36.640
I'll wait for you outside, okay?

00:32:38.360 --> 00:32:39.680
- I'll be right around here.
- Mm.

00:32:42.120 --> 00:32:43.760
My dear friend!

00:32:44.040 --> 00:32:46.120
I said I'd come pick you up,
and you refused.

00:32:46.440 --> 00:32:47.920
On your bike?

00:32:48.320 --> 00:32:49.880
I'd rather walk here barefoot.

00:32:49.920 --> 00:32:51.520
You're a reckless rider.

00:32:51.720 --> 00:32:53.600
Come on now.

00:32:55.800 --> 00:32:57.040
Are you upset?

00:32:58.600 --> 00:33:00.440
Here. I got you coffee.

00:33:03.280 --> 00:33:04.280
- Thanks.
- Wait...

00:33:06.640 --> 00:33:08.720
Why do your under-eyes look so dark?

00:33:09.320 --> 00:33:10.840
Like you've been cursed or something.

00:33:11.800 --> 00:33:13.000
Watch what you're saying.

00:33:13.600 --> 00:33:15.680
Did you ask your dentist on your last visit

00:33:15.720 --> 00:33:17.480
to remove the filth from your mouth?

00:33:18.160 --> 00:33:21.000
I'm foul-mouthed to the core.

00:33:21.480 --> 00:33:22.760
There's no way to remove it.

00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:32.480
- Good morning.
- Good morning!

00:33:32.520 --> 00:33:34.440
- Are you Master Win and his manager?
- Yes.

00:33:35.240 --> 00:33:37.640
We're the White Knight Seer team.

00:33:38.040 --> 00:33:40.600
This sleepy face is Master Win.

00:33:40.640 --> 00:33:43.320
I'm Namo Wiriya, his manager.

00:33:43.360 --> 00:33:45.160
Oh, and here's my business card.

00:33:46.520 --> 00:33:47.520
Here.

00:33:48.120 --> 00:33:51.520
We provide fortune telling
and feng shui consultations nationwide.

00:33:51.800 --> 00:33:53.880
If you're interested,
feel free to contact us 24/7.

00:33:53.920 --> 00:33:54.560
Sure.

00:33:54.600 --> 00:33:57.080
I'm Nokphaeng, Phloeng's manager.

00:33:57.120 --> 00:34:01.080
Also the producer
and creative director of Siam Nithrarom.

00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:04.120
Nice to meet you, Nokphaeng.

00:34:04.160 --> 00:34:05.200
Nice to meet you as well.

00:34:05.240 --> 00:34:06.640
Then, please come this way.

00:34:13.720 --> 00:34:16.560
So, what kind of shows do they produce here?

00:34:17.520 --> 00:34:19.040
The most famous one would be

00:34:19.080 --> 00:34:20.600
'Spooky Hellish Night.'

00:34:22.360 --> 00:34:24.160
Any other shows?

00:34:25.080 --> 00:34:26.600
There's...

00:34:26.880 --> 00:34:29.240
'Fiery Tongues, ' 'Gays Go Places, '

00:34:29.840 --> 00:34:31.960
and 'Guess Who's Dead!'

00:34:38.400 --> 00:34:39.400
Dude.

00:34:39.480 --> 00:34:40.760
That's Phloeng.

00:34:49.640 --> 00:34:52.080
(Phloengnathitorn: Spooky Hellish Night)

00:34:53.360 --> 00:34:55.640
Why is he walking around dressed like that?

00:34:57.680 --> 00:34:58.920
It's hot, I guess.

00:35:00.040 --> 00:35:04.000
But, is his name just 'Phloeng, '

00:35:04.600 --> 00:35:06.160
and his surname 'Nathitorn'?

00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:09.000
Nope, his name is Phloengnathitorn.

00:35:09.400 --> 00:35:11.200
Phloeng is the nickname.

00:35:11.240 --> 00:35:15.520
But his full name is
Phloengnathitorn Asvadevadhamasthitya.

00:35:15.560 --> 00:35:16.560
Huh?

00:35:16.600 --> 00:35:17.600
Can you repeat that?

00:35:17.880 --> 00:35:21.800
Phloengnathitorn Asvadevadhamasthitya.

00:35:21.960 --> 00:35:23.040
Gosh.

00:35:23.080 --> 00:35:24.480
Isn't that a bit too lengthy?

00:35:24.760 --> 00:35:27.960
Any name is long
compared to yours, Win Wongsawat.

00:35:30.400 --> 00:35:32.240
(Phloengnathitorn: Spooky Hellish Night)

00:35:33.080 --> 00:35:34.600
Oh, I'll be right back.

00:35:34.840 --> 00:35:36.680
Hey, where are you going?

00:35:36.720 --> 00:35:38.200
Don't worry. I'll be back in a flash.

00:35:38.400 --> 00:35:39.400
Whatever.

00:35:59.720 --> 00:36:01.040
What are you doing, boss?

00:36:01.760 --> 00:36:03.680
No. I'm not doing anything.

00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:06.640
Don't you have work to do, Job?

00:36:07.640 --> 00:36:08.640
Of course, I do.

00:36:09.840 --> 00:36:12.240
But why don't you approach him
if you're interested, boss?

00:36:13.160 --> 00:36:16.480
You even got Nokphaeng
to invite him on the show.

00:36:17.520 --> 00:36:18.720
Don't let this go to waste.

00:36:18.760 --> 00:36:20.240
Nokphaeng agrees he's a lovely guy.

00:36:22.880 --> 00:36:24.880
No comment.
I'm going back to work.

00:37:50.400 --> 00:37:51.760
It smells so lovely.

00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:54.360
Is this a special pillow to help with sleeping?

00:37:55.960 --> 00:37:56.960
Hello.

00:37:57.160 --> 00:37:58.720
Are you Master Win?

00:37:59.920 --> 00:38:00.560
I am.

00:38:00.600 --> 00:38:02.320
Sorry to keep you waiting.

00:38:03.320 --> 00:38:04.160
Right.

00:38:04.200 --> 00:38:05.680
Please wait here for a bit.

00:38:05.720 --> 00:38:06.760
Phloeng will be here soon.

00:38:09.400 --> 00:38:11.640
So... I don't need to do any makeup?

00:38:11.680 --> 00:38:13.160
Oh, no.

00:38:13.200 --> 00:38:14.680
Today's session is a podcast.

00:38:15.200 --> 00:38:16.480
No fancy stuff needed.

00:38:16.520 --> 00:38:17.720
The crew didn't tell you that?

00:38:18.440 --> 00:38:19.440
No...

00:38:19.640 --> 00:38:21.680
Then, here's everything in brief.

00:38:21.840 --> 00:38:26.120
So, Nokphaeng wants the show
to feel as natural as possible.

00:38:26.440 --> 00:38:29.320
And I need to tell ghost stories, correct?

00:38:29.600 --> 00:38:32.600
Would a childhood story work?

00:38:32.640 --> 00:38:35.000
Uh, no. You don't need to tell any stories.

00:38:35.040 --> 00:38:36.240
What? Really?

00:38:36.960 --> 00:38:39.040
We actually invited you here

00:38:39.520 --> 00:38:42.600
as a guest clairvoyant expert.

00:38:42.640 --> 00:38:43.640
Huh?

00:38:43.720 --> 00:38:45.600
A clairvoyant expert?

00:38:45.840 --> 00:38:46.800
That's right.

00:38:46.840 --> 00:38:50.520
Nokphaeng wanted new methods
to make the show more interesting.

00:38:50.800 --> 00:38:53.480
So, he wanted someone
with special senses on the show.

00:38:53.640 --> 00:38:55.440
The storyteller for this EP is Jaab.

00:38:55.480 --> 00:38:58.080
He's going to share his story
about being cursed.

00:38:58.720 --> 00:39:00.440
And your job

00:39:00.920 --> 00:39:02.920
is to contact the spirits.

00:39:03.560 --> 00:39:05.040
Contact the spirits?

00:39:05.440 --> 00:39:10.120
But the crew invited me here
to tell ghost stories, didn't they?

00:39:10.520 --> 00:39:11.720
Certainly not.

00:39:12.160 --> 00:39:14.480
The project coordinator
clearly specified that

00:39:14.520 --> 00:39:18.680
Master Win will be contacting the dead
on behalf of the storyteller.

00:39:19.440 --> 00:39:20.520
And...

00:39:20.800 --> 00:39:23.120
Oh, Phloeng is here.

00:39:23.400 --> 00:39:25.040
He'll explain further.

00:39:26.720 --> 00:39:27.800
Hello, Master.

00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:29.440
I'm Phloengnathitorn.

00:39:40.360 --> 00:39:41.920
Phloengnathitorn?

00:39:42.160 --> 00:39:43.840
The one behind the summer scent.

00:39:49.000 --> 00:39:52.080
Has Job already told you that
you'll be contacting the spirits?

00:39:53.840 --> 00:39:54.840
Yes.

00:39:55.000 --> 00:39:56.360
He just told me that, actually.

00:39:56.400 --> 00:39:58.360
Then, let's get to it.

00:39:58.720 --> 00:39:59.720
Hold on.

00:40:00.320 --> 00:40:02.960
You're not going to tell me
Jaab's story in brief?

00:40:03.880 --> 00:40:05.920
Oh, I've read it.

00:40:07.240 --> 00:40:09.760
But... Job said

00:40:10.400 --> 00:40:14.160
you'd tell me his story beforehand.

00:40:15.240 --> 00:40:16.440
You'll be fine.

00:40:16.480 --> 00:40:18.440
I'm the host anyway.

00:40:18.480 --> 00:40:20.000
You just go with the flow.

00:40:22.880 --> 00:40:25.200
So, can I have tarot cards?

00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:27.000
Tarot cards?

00:40:27.080 --> 00:40:29.120
Well, I'm a Tarot card reader.

00:40:29.920 --> 00:40:32.600
To contact the spirits,
I need them.

00:40:41.400 --> 00:40:44.360
Dude, if this EP goes live,

00:40:44.960 --> 00:40:48.520
my career is gonna be in ruins...

00:40:48.920 --> 00:40:51.040
Come on! You're exaggerating.

00:40:51.560 --> 00:40:53.920
Everybody loves you, Win.

00:40:54.120 --> 00:40:56.480
So, where were you
when I was doing the podcast?

00:40:57.960 --> 00:40:59.480
I... didn't want to disturb you.

00:41:00.040 --> 00:41:01.320
How about this? You wait here.

00:41:01.360 --> 00:41:03.080
I'll get my motorbike and ride us home.

00:41:03.240 --> 00:41:04.240
Okay?

00:41:04.760 --> 00:41:05.800
Fine.

00:41:06.080 --> 00:41:07.440
So you end up riding home with me.

00:41:08.120 --> 00:41:09.120
Be back soon!

00:41:21.120 --> 00:41:22.320
Excuse me?

00:41:33.880 --> 00:41:35.440
What are you doing here, little guy?

00:41:35.640 --> 00:41:38.200
Can you take me to Papa Phloeng?

00:41:39.760 --> 00:41:40.760
Phloeng?

00:41:42.920 --> 00:41:44.240
Which Phloeng do you mean?

00:41:44.560 --> 00:41:45.800
I don't know.

00:41:45.840 --> 00:41:48.520
I only know Papa's name is Phloeng.

00:41:52.320 --> 00:41:53.440
Is it this man?

00:41:55.080 --> 00:41:56.160
Yes! It's him!

00:41:56.200 --> 00:41:58.080
My Papa Phloeng!

00:41:58.800 --> 00:41:59.800
Hm?

00:42:00.040 --> 00:42:01.040
Phloeng...

00:42:01.520 --> 00:42:03.040
He's keeping his son a secret?

00:42:03.600 --> 00:42:05.280
Can you take me to him?

00:42:07.480 --> 00:42:08.560
Of course.

00:42:08.840 --> 00:42:10.120
Why can't I do that?

00:42:10.160 --> 00:42:11.240
Let me take him to you.

00:42:16.200 --> 00:42:17.240
Let's go, Yok.

00:42:17.280 --> 00:42:18.800
Follow me.

00:42:48.240 --> 00:42:49.240
You're still here?

00:42:55.240 --> 00:42:56.440
What's this?

00:42:56.480 --> 00:42:58.720
The Radiance of the Seven Gems?

00:42:59.040 --> 00:43:01.480
It's the light of a highly virtuous person.

00:43:01.920 --> 00:43:04.000
That would explain

00:43:04.200 --> 00:43:06.440
why no ghosts could enter the building.

00:43:08.600 --> 00:43:09.600
Master?

00:43:11.280 --> 00:43:12.600
Are you staring at my chest?

00:43:19.440 --> 00:43:20.960
A highly virtuous soul...

00:43:33.440 --> 00:43:38.840
(Directed by: Siwasit Phondongnok)

00:43:39.000 --> 00:43:41.000
and it says that it happens at 25.

00:43:41.400 --> 00:43:42.920
That means I've made it, haven't I?

00:43:43.200 --> 00:43:46.360
You need to seek help
from a highly virtuous individual.

00:43:46.600 --> 00:43:49.760
Who is my karmic creditor,
that the Venerable Father told me about?

00:43:59.200 --> 00:44:00.200
Win...

00:44:01.320 --> 00:44:02.760
No, you're still alive.
