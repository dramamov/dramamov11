Excuse me.

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:47.350
It's okay. Really. I'm not some kind of creep.

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:52.560
You're Yun Dong Hee's doctor, right?

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:56.000
I've called you dozens of times, and I've come looking for you.

00:01:56.400 --> 00:02:00.970
I even left all those messages. Please, just give me a moment.

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:02.300
What is this about?

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:05.740
In that case, let me just ask you one thing.

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:07.870
The medication Yun Dong Hee was on,

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:10.110
did you prescribe it?

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:14.680
It's all right. Please, just tell me the truth.

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:16.550
Because of Yun Dong Hee,

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:20.190
- someone could be in danger. - I have nothing to say.

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:24.930
You didn't do this alone, did you? Someone put you up to this, right?

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:30.230
Detective or not, you can't be here. This is completely out of line.

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:31.770
I'm sorry.

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:35.470
I'm not trying to make this difficult for you.

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:18.680
Early this morning, on an Ilsan apartment rooftop,

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:21.179
a doctor in her 40s fell to her death.

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:25.189
The woman, a psychiatrist at the National Forensic Hospital,

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:26.690
was recently suffering...

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:28.589
- Where did he go? - from extreme work-related stress.

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:31.289
Based on the apartment's CCTV footage,

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:33.560
police believe she jumped to her death.

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:36.499
Meanwhile, police plan to investigate...

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:37.900
the exact circumstances of the fall.

Hey, it's dangerous there. What are you doing?

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:12.100
Hurry up and get out.

00:04:18.270 --> 00:04:19.910
Gosh, a woman, all by herself?

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:24.880
Are you sure Dr. Cha So Yeon jumped?

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:27.109
There are no signs of foul play.

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:29.250
She must've been under great pressure.

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:35.390
Hey, you said she was on duty the day Yun Dong Hee escaped, right?

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:37.820
Yes. She was sleeping in the on-call room,

00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:39.830
and it was all caught on CCTV.

00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:44.259
No, let go of me! Let me see his personal physician!

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:45.969
Why on earth not?

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:47.800
I told you, she's not here right now.

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:50.300
Darn it. So she was at the hospital after all.

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:53.210
Let me know as soon as Cha So Yeon's autopsy results are in.

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:55.180
Her family is refusing an autopsy.

00:04:55.910 --> 00:04:58.040
What? Why would they refuse?

00:04:58.180 --> 00:05:00.049
There were no signs of foul play.

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:01.620
Besides, she apparently wasn't eating,

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:04.990
and she wasn't sleeping well either. They're closing the case soon.

00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:09.060
I have to watch my back, too. Word is you're stuck on Yun Dong Hee.

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:10.360
My bad.

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:12.160
Thanks, anyway.

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:19.870
Hey, appreciate all the hard work. Yes, thank you.

00:05:21.570 --> 00:05:23.500
Could I take a look at the CCTV footage?

00:05:23.670 --> 00:05:25.069
Are you asking about the doctor?

00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:27.770
The police already took the footage from after she left work yesterday.

00:05:27.910 --> 00:05:29.310
Yes, I know all about that.

00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:33.810
I need footage from all cameras, about two days' worth.

00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:37.680
You'll need an official request for that.

00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:41.990
That's why I brought this for you. See?

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:44.420

You haven't changed a bit.

Do those two know each other?

00:06:38.140 --> 00:06:42.950
I guess they're close. She told him he hasn't changed a bit.

Hey, aren't you going home?

00:06:46.290 --> 00:06:47.320
Yes, I'm heading out.

She's crying. I never thought Pillip was like that.

Making a woman cry just like that.

00:07:00.130 --> 00:07:04.240

I fell for the same thing a few years ago,

and this time, I still didn't read the contract properly.

It's not your fault, Sun Mi.

00:09:39.390 --> 00:09:41.690
The contract that exploits legal loopholes is the problem.

00:09:42.760 --> 00:09:46.200
They treat you like a regular employee but pay you peanuts,

00:09:46.530 --> 00:09:49.470
and when there's a problem, the company takes no responsibility.

00:09:49.540 --> 00:09:51.940
So does that mean I won't get paid?

She was probably upset.

He's taking the day off. The nerve, taking days off when I don't.

A few days ago, I got a spam text from Yun Dong Hee's number,

00:11:52.790 --> 00:11:55.460
and it led to the same bank as before.

No, it won't go through.

On the day the money was deposited, something must have happened.

Hey, Mr. Shin. You said this was only about money.

Just sitting around like this is driving me crazy.

Hey, don't get in too deep. Gosh, you're making me nervous.

Did you hear that from Ms. Cheon?

00:12:48.850 --> 00:12:51.280

What were you thinking, meeting a lawyer so openly?

00:13:08.200 --> 00:13:10.800
When you do that, it puts all of us in a bad spot.

I'm begging you, just stop.

00:13:29.760 --> 00:13:32.830
We didn't even get paid. We just got on the manager's bad side!

00:13:33.990 --> 00:13:37.460
- I'm sorry. - Please, don't drag us into this.

00:13:43.570 --> 00:13:46.640
- The CEO is away on business. - When is he expected back?

00:13:46.710 --> 00:13:47.740
Next week.

00:13:53.710 --> 00:13:54.750

00:13:57.720 --> 00:14:00.350
Is this better than padding? This...

Perfect. I'll buy this for now.

00:14:12.100 --> 00:14:13.870
If this works... Man.

00:14:16.100 --> 00:14:18.640
Won't I look way too jacked?

00:14:20.270 --> 00:14:22.980
If you want to leave your info, I can pass it along to him.

00:14:23.110 --> 00:14:25.380
That's all right. I'll just come back next week.

00:14:25.810 --> 00:14:28.950
- Okay. - It's all ready for CEO Hong.

00:14:31.250 --> 00:14:32.250
Cho Pillip?

00:14:32.251 --> 00:14:34.190
Wait, Dong Seok? What are you doing here?

00:14:34.650 --> 00:14:35.920
What do you think?

00:14:36.420 --> 00:14:39.460
I'm the legal counsel for PHG.

00:14:41.530 --> 00:14:42.530
I see.

00:14:43.260 --> 00:14:44.260
Is that right?

00:14:45.500 --> 00:14:49.100
You must be hot. Here, drink up. There you go.

00:14:50.270 --> 00:14:54.110
It seems PHG has its employees sign independent contractor agreements.

00:14:54.570 --> 00:14:56.210
And it's designed to make it hard to prove their employment.

00:14:56.310 --> 00:14:58.950
That's pretty much a standard contract in this industry.

00:14:59.280 --> 00:15:00.650
It says it all right there.

00:15:00.950 --> 00:15:02.349
Despite being fully informed about...

00:15:02.350 --> 00:15:04.350
the option of an employment contract,

00:15:04.420 --> 00:15:06.119
the party agreed to sign this agreement.

00:15:06.120 --> 00:15:07.790
They knew exactly what they signed.

00:15:07.990 --> 00:15:09.590
You must have drafted it yourself.

00:15:09.660 --> 00:15:12.330
That's why it's legally airtight.

00:15:13.760 --> 00:15:15.459
Airtight for the employer, maybe.

00:15:15.460 --> 00:15:17.130
But unfair to the helpless employees.

00:15:17.200 --> 00:15:20.870
That's the mark of a good lawyer. You must give your client an edge.

00:15:21.700 --> 00:15:25.740
And are you aware your client hasn't paid employees in six months?

00:15:26.970 --> 00:15:29.880
Such minor details don't concern me. Why?

00:15:29.940 --> 00:15:31.010
Is someone suing?

00:15:32.380 --> 00:15:33.380
Which branch?

00:15:36.520 --> 00:15:38.180
Hey, leaving already?

00:15:38.520 --> 00:15:40.890
I should get going. The contract you drew up,

00:15:40.950 --> 00:15:42.890
isn't a display of a lawyer's skill. It's just legal maneuvering.

00:15:43.160 --> 00:15:44.489
And it doesn't just favor your client.

00:15:44.490 --> 00:15:46.230
It encourages illegal activity.

00:15:47.090 --> 00:15:48.630
It looks like there's a lot to review, legally speaking.

00:15:54.070 --> 00:15:55.300
See yourself out.

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:00.340
That disrespectful little punk. Darn it.

00:16:02.280 --> 00:16:04.910
He gets appointed as a judge and suddenly has no respect...

00:16:06.980 --> 00:16:08.050
Gosh, that son of a...

00:16:19.290 --> 00:16:22.860
That punk shows up out of nowhere and starts making trouble. Bastard.

00:16:23.730 --> 00:16:24.830
Did you get ahold of CEO Hong?

00:16:24.900 --> 00:16:28.000
He said he's surfing all day and asked not to be contacted.

00:16:28.800 --> 00:16:31.740
Gosh, that guy's head is always in the clouds.

00:16:32.310 --> 00:16:33.640
He doesn't realize how critical this is.

00:16:34.540 --> 00:16:36.780
Which branches had the unpaid wages again?

00:16:36.910 --> 00:16:40.250
The Maheon 1 and 2 branches, and the Chungsan 1 branch...

00:16:40.310 --> 00:16:41.580
Alright, I get it.

00:16:42.280 --> 00:16:44.180
Get me all of the employee contracts from those locations.

00:16:44.950 --> 00:16:49.160
The conditions are different from the contract. Take a look.

00:16:51.790 --> 00:16:54.560
It's a bit of a gray area to report as a labor law violation,

00:16:54.890 --> 00:16:56.560
and I'm not sure we'd be able to win in court.

00:16:58.300 --> 00:17:02.200
This is technically airtight, so maybe we need to find a new angle.

00:17:03.370 --> 00:17:05.510
Have you ever handled a similar case?

00:17:06.440 --> 00:17:07.470
Hold on a second.

00:17:15.620 --> 00:17:16.620
Look at this.

00:17:28.390 --> 00:17:29.460

Man, why are there so many delivery orders today?

00:17:46.750 --> 00:17:49.679
- They just keep coming. - I packed the drinks and radish.

00:17:49.680 --> 00:17:50.719
Okay.

00:17:50.720 --> 00:17:52.290
Seriously, that Pillip kid.

00:17:52.350 --> 00:17:54.650
Taking a day off at a time like this?

00:17:54.990 --> 00:17:56.460
He's absolutely useless.

00:17:56.520 --> 00:17:59.460
- I saw him walk by earlier today. - You're kidding. Where?

00:18:00.430 --> 00:18:01.890
He was with some woman.

00:18:02.430 --> 00:18:03.460
What woman?

00:18:03.630 --> 00:18:06.670
The pretty woman from last night. I'll be back.

00:18:06.730 --> 00:18:08.570
Okay, be careful.

00:18:12.100 --> 00:18:14.810
It's funny how she can tell that other people are pretty,

00:18:15.440 --> 00:18:17.380
but she's clueless about how pretty she is.

Help yourselves, everyone. Eat up.

00:18:52.710 --> 00:18:54.280
- Thank you for the food! - Thank you!

00:18:54.350 --> 00:18:55.350
Sure.

00:18:55.450 --> 00:18:57.850
Let's eat. Come on, dig in.

00:18:59.890 --> 00:19:02.690
You could've just come by yourself. You brought your whole crew.

00:19:02.790 --> 00:19:04.719
They had to come pay their respects.

00:19:04.720 --> 00:19:07.660
And my guys here, they just, you know,

00:19:07.730 --> 00:19:08.760
love this chicken.

00:19:09.900 --> 00:19:14.100
Hey, no need to worry about me. My restaurant is doing just fine.

00:19:14.630 --> 00:19:16.400
It's a nice, cozy little place.

00:19:16.500 --> 00:19:20.340
For some reason, it feels especially cozy today.

00:19:21.040 --> 00:19:22.710
How have you been? Things slow?

00:19:22.780 --> 00:19:26.080
Gosh, business is very slow right now, so no, not busy at all.

00:19:26.410 --> 00:19:28.649
But even if I was swamped, Mr. Shin,

00:19:28.650 --> 00:19:30.680
I'd drop everything and come running.

00:19:30.780 --> 00:19:33.820
After all, you're the reason I'm able to make an honest living.

00:19:34.250 --> 00:19:36.160
- Hey, Kim. - Yes, sir.

00:19:37.090 --> 00:19:40.360
- I need to ask you for a favor. - Of course. Name it, sir.

00:19:55.540 --> 00:19:56.680
(Chicken Center)

00:20:00.250 --> 00:20:02.780
- That was incredibly delicious! - That was incredibly delicious!

00:20:04.620 --> 00:20:06.619
All right, guys, get in the cars.

00:20:06.620 --> 00:20:07.689
We're drawing too much attention,

00:20:07.690 --> 00:20:09.420
and a big group makes us look more suspicious.

00:20:10.390 --> 00:20:12.390
- Let's go! - Right away, sir!

00:20:17.760 --> 00:20:19.430
- Sir. - Yes?

00:20:19.500 --> 00:20:22.840
I have a few "tools" lying around. You should come for an "inspection."

00:20:23.840 --> 00:20:26.070
A chainsaw, a pickaxe, and a crowbar.

00:20:26.540 --> 00:20:28.070
Let me know if you need any equipment.

00:20:28.410 --> 00:20:30.880
No. That's far enough, Kim.

00:20:31.580 --> 00:20:33.380
I'll handle the rest from here.

00:20:33.510 --> 00:20:35.480
- Understood, sir. - Thanks.

00:20:35.550 --> 00:20:36.679
- Thanks for the food, sir! - Anytime.

00:20:36.680 --> 00:20:38.920
- Right. - Get home safe.

00:20:39.050 --> 00:20:40.050
Thank you, sir.

00:20:44.390 --> 00:20:47.890
What? A chainsaw, a pickaxe, and a crowbar?

00:20:47.990 --> 00:20:51.700
Yes. You told me to report strange things.

00:20:52.100 --> 00:20:53.370
This qualifies as strange, right?

00:20:53.730 --> 00:20:55.769
Huge guys were bowing deeply to him,

00:20:55.770 --> 00:20:58.240
and this was long after closing time.

00:21:01.670 --> 00:21:02.810
What did his accent sound like?

00:21:03.110 --> 00:21:04.440
He had a strong regional accent.

00:21:05.850 --> 00:21:07.250
Do you know him, Judge Kim?

00:21:08.280 --> 00:21:11.350
- He's in construction. Ex-gangster. - A gangster?

00:21:13.120 --> 00:21:15.190
And he said Mr. Shin would "handle the rest."

00:21:16.390 --> 00:21:18.020
What do you suppose he meant by "handle it?"

00:21:18.090 --> 00:21:19.760
That's what you have to find out.

00:21:20.890 --> 00:21:22.800
Find out what dangerous business Mr. Shin is getting into.

00:21:23.700 --> 00:21:24.730
Could it be related to Jun...

00:21:26.900 --> 00:21:28.630
this time, too?

00:21:35.910 --> 00:21:38.610
Hey, it's been a while. I was hoping you could do me a favor.

00:21:39.810 --> 00:21:41.750
It's just a really old case, so there aren't any records.

00:21:43.820 --> 00:21:44.850
Thanks.

00:21:52.960 --> 00:21:53.960
Si On!

00:21:56.160 --> 00:21:57.160
Si...

00:22:11.240 --> 00:22:13.810
- You're here early. - How was your date yesterday?

00:22:15.180 --> 00:22:16.180
What date?

00:22:16.250 --> 00:22:18.780
I heard you were with that woman who came by the other day.

00:22:21.090 --> 00:22:24.790
- You mean Sun Mi? It wasn't a date. - So her name's Sun Mi?

00:22:25.160 --> 00:22:26.160
Yes.

00:22:28.160 --> 00:22:30.429
A few years ago, the franchise owners of a macaron shop...

00:22:30.430 --> 00:22:33.329
called Daldalbongju filed a class-action lawsuit...

00:22:33.330 --> 00:22:34.730
against the head office.

00:22:34.900 --> 00:22:37.340
There were persistent problems with inflated supply costs.

00:22:37.400 --> 00:22:38.740
(Daldalbongju Margin Fee Class-Action Lawsuit)

00:22:43.280 --> 00:22:46.350
Back then, Mo Sun Mi was a young startup franchisee.

00:22:46.410 --> 00:22:49.880
Punish the Daldalbongju head office for taking unfair profits!

00:22:49.980 --> 00:22:51.579
- Punish them! Punish them! - After a year and a half,

00:22:51.580 --> 00:22:52.920
the head office won the first trial.

00:22:53.790 --> 00:22:56.090
And I was the lawyer for the head office.

00:22:56.860 --> 00:22:58.189
We'll take care of it all.

00:22:58.190 --> 00:23:00.760
Right. Let's go.

00:23:01.130 --> 00:23:02.290
Yes, let's get going.

00:23:03.200 --> 00:23:06.970
- Punish them! Punish them! - Punish them! Punish them!

00:23:07.170 --> 00:23:10.370
Then I guess that makes you her worst enemy.

00:23:10.670 --> 00:23:12.170
Not her enemy, exactly.

00:23:12.770 --> 00:23:14.539
I even told her about a precedent...

00:23:14.540 --> 00:23:17.510
where franchisees won a similar case.

00:23:17.640 --> 00:23:19.750
Wait, why? Feeling guilty?

00:23:19.810 --> 00:23:21.680
That's an ethics violation for a lawyer, you know.

00:23:21.980 --> 00:23:25.320
It's not a violation. Besides, legal precedents are public.

00:23:26.350 --> 00:23:30.690
After I quit the firm, I took on a few cases pro bono,

00:23:31.420 --> 00:23:33.190
but I couldn't help Sun Mi with her appeal.

00:23:33.730 --> 00:23:36.559
The head office delayed the deadlines and postponed the trial,

00:23:36.560 --> 00:23:38.660
so it's still not moving forward.

00:23:39.770 --> 00:23:40.770
So?

00:23:41.100 --> 00:23:44.400
Sun Mi's in a really tough spot.

00:23:44.740 --> 00:23:47.110
She has to pay back her startup loan,

00:23:47.370 --> 00:23:48.810
and prepare for the appeal,

00:23:49.140 --> 00:23:51.309
but she hasn't been paid in six months,

00:23:51.310 --> 00:23:53.880
so she's homeless and lives at a gym.

00:23:55.050 --> 00:23:56.650
So, this time...

00:23:57.780 --> 00:23:59.820
I really want to help Sun Mi.

00:24:00.520 --> 00:24:03.590
The law shouldn't be a hindrance for young people trying to make it.

00:24:04.120 --> 00:24:06.530
So is this what you came up with?

00:24:07.260 --> 00:24:08.290
You think you can win with this?

00:24:08.760 --> 00:24:09.760
Yes.

00:24:10.300 --> 00:24:12.299
So they can't pull this stunt again,

00:24:12.300 --> 00:24:13.830
I want to pull them out by the roots.

00:24:14.400 --> 00:24:16.570
Right, but how does this let you pull them out by the roots?

00:24:16.900 --> 00:24:19.040
With another "Article-something, Clause-something" argument?

00:24:19.310 --> 00:24:20.710
There's none of that in here.

00:24:21.710 --> 00:24:23.180
So I'm going to create it myself.

00:24:27.310 --> 00:24:28.350
You confident?

00:24:30.620 --> 00:24:31.720
Yes.

00:24:32.280 --> 00:24:33.350
I'm confident.

00:24:35.590 --> 00:24:38.560
Go ahead. I'll help you. On one condition.

00:24:38.620 --> 00:24:39.730
Give and take.

00:24:40.190 --> 00:24:41.790
I'll be sure to repay the favor.

00:24:42.700 --> 00:24:45.600
Getting hit with this? Yes, that would hurt.

00:24:48.400 --> 00:24:50.669
A chainsaw, a pickaxe, and a crowbar.

00:24:50.670 --> 00:24:52.500
I'll handle the rest from here.

00:24:57.540 --> 00:24:58.540
What is it?

No. It's nothing.

Gosh, who works out this early in the morning?

00:25:07.820 --> 00:25:10.860
That's why they call it a morning workout.

00:25:10.920 --> 00:25:13.160
Exercise is great! A marathon? Or a run in the park?

00:25:13.260 --> 00:25:14.260
This all used to be muscle.

00:25:14.261 --> 00:25:16.000
- Look at you, all excited. - You're all here.

00:25:16.600 --> 00:25:17.730
What? Pillip?

00:25:19.030 --> 00:25:22.600
I'm going to this place. First session is free. Don't miss it.

00:25:22.770 --> 00:25:24.800
- What is this? - PHG?

00:25:25.100 --> 00:25:29.340
Hey, isn't this that place? Where the woman with Pillip works.

00:25:29.510 --> 00:25:30.510
What?

00:25:31.140 --> 00:25:33.410
- I'm not going. - Playing the supportive boyfriend?

00:25:33.480 --> 00:25:34.480
Come on, what are you talking about?

00:25:34.481 --> 00:25:36.280
There's nothing between Sun Mi and me.

00:25:36.350 --> 00:25:38.420
That's what all the cheaters say.

00:25:39.320 --> 00:25:41.390
There was another woman? You had another one?

00:25:41.690 --> 00:25:44.390
Hey, will you just stop with the nonsense?

00:25:44.720 --> 00:25:47.260
This guy's a breeding ground for fake news.

00:25:47.560 --> 00:25:49.930
You keep that up and you'll all end up in cuffs.

00:25:52.100 --> 00:25:53.870
- Another one? Really? - No, I'm serious.

00:25:53.930 --> 00:25:55.030
- Just for today. - There was another one?

00:25:57.040 --> 00:25:58.540
Extend your arms more. All the way out.

00:25:59.640 --> 00:26:02.240
Don't lean forward. You need to lean back, back.

00:26:02.310 --> 00:26:03.710
I can do this.

00:26:03.780 --> 00:26:05.540
You're leaning forward again. Open up your chest.

00:26:08.910 --> 00:26:09.920
All the way.

00:26:10.220 --> 00:26:13.150
Don't pull with your arms. Use your back. Pull with your back.

00:26:13.420 --> 00:26:14.990
My back has a mind of its own.

We got no new members this month. I'm so sorry.

00:26:31.670 --> 00:26:32.910
Don't worry about it.

00:26:38.210 --> 00:26:40.410
Spare me!

00:26:42.050 --> 00:26:44.220
Just keep going and I'll come around to check on you all.

00:26:44.580 --> 00:26:49.150
Don't make your strides too long. And remember to breathe. Okay.

00:26:49.460 --> 00:26:51.420
Sir, how much did you walk yesterday?

00:26:52.220 --> 00:26:53.290
About 20,000 steps.

00:26:53.360 --> 00:26:55.060
You really shouldn't be walking that much.

00:26:55.130 --> 00:26:57.730
Why does he keep showing up? It's not like he's going to help out.

00:26:57.800 --> 00:26:59.830
I know, right? What if the store manager sees him?

00:27:00.030 --> 00:27:02.330
What can we do about it? We'll be the ones to clean up his mess.

00:27:06.940 --> 00:27:07.940
Yes, I understand.

00:27:08.410 --> 00:27:09.410

What are you talking about?

I should help Sun Mi the way she needs, not just the way I want to,

00:27:39.100 --> 00:27:40.339
but I was so eager to help...

00:27:40.340 --> 00:27:42.010
I'm worried I made her uncomfortable.

00:27:42.070 --> 00:27:43.080
Look.

00:27:43.380 --> 00:27:45.980
The trainers commit card fraud to meet their quotas,

00:27:46.040 --> 00:27:49.150
plus they have unpaid wages and are behind on the electric bill.

There's nothing to talk about.

- Are you mad at me? - No.

00:28:40.730 --> 00:28:42.630
Then why have you been avoiding me since yesterday?

00:28:43.100 --> 00:28:46.040
- I'm not avoiding you. - You're doing it right now.

00:28:47.540 --> 00:28:49.040

But still, there has to be a reason.

What is wrong with me? Why do I keep getting so angry?

00:29:25.240 --> 00:29:26.280
What are you doing?

00:29:27.750 --> 00:29:30.450
Nothing. I can't do a thing.

00:29:33.750 --> 00:29:35.450
Could you close up the laundromat for me?

00:29:48.030 --> 00:29:52.440
This place was a kindergarten, see? But low birth rates are a problem.

00:29:52.640 --> 00:29:56.940
We can pour concrete here and add a steel door back here, right?

00:29:57.010 --> 00:29:59.439
Right. We need better soundproofing. Hold on.

00:29:59.440 --> 00:30:01.980
If you need water to clean up blood, we can just bring a water tank over.

Trouble? No, it was nothing.

When I first won it at auction,

00:30:13.760 --> 00:30:15.990
the surrounding land was all tied up.

This whole area, front and back, it's all my private property now.

00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:22.600
You could bury someone here, and no one would ever find them.

I have no intention of giving them a proper burial.

00:30:26.040 --> 00:30:28.840
And I don't plan to cause you trouble either.

00:30:28.940 --> 00:30:30.310
What about tools?

00:30:30.680 --> 00:30:32.810

This place is perfect.

Good work, Boss.

00:31:20.160 --> 00:31:22.130
- Thanks. - I'll be in touch.

00:31:22.190 --> 00:31:22.569
Okay.

00:31:22.948 --> 00:31:24.188

00:31:24.248 --> 00:31:27.058
- Yes. We should hang out again. - Lee Ye On! Ban Han!

Si On!

00:31:30.588 --> 00:31:31.828
You came early!

00:31:31.888 --> 00:31:34.427
Yes. I'm taking a break from night deliveries until my exam.

00:31:34.428 --> 00:31:35.728
But why is Han here?

00:31:35.828 --> 00:31:37.928
We were playing at Han's house,

00:31:38.668 --> 00:31:40.438
and he came to walk me home.

00:31:40.498 --> 00:31:43.168
It's not safe for Ye On to go home by herself.

00:31:43.868 --> 00:31:47.078
- And how are you getting home, Han? - Come on, I'm a guy.

00:31:51.808 --> 00:31:54.978
You two are something else. I thought you fought and were done.

00:31:55.378 --> 00:31:56.948
And now look at you, holding hands.

00:31:57.348 --> 00:32:00.058
That was yesterday. On our way to the field trip,

00:32:00.118 --> 00:32:04.788
I was just mad because Han sat next to Seo Ah.

00:32:05.528 --> 00:32:06.628
Why would that make you mad?

00:32:06.698 --> 00:32:08.997
Because I like Han.

00:32:08.998 --> 00:32:12.498
And besides, Seo Ah has long hair and she's so pretty.

00:32:12.728 --> 00:32:17.308
No way. You're way cuter and prettier.

00:32:18.308 --> 00:32:21.938
- You mean it? - Yes. You're infinitely prettier.

00:32:23.608 --> 00:32:25.178
I can't watch this.

00:32:25.808 --> 00:32:27.248
She's just jealous.

00:32:27.378 --> 00:32:29.748
Why? Doesn't she have a boyfriend?

00:32:29.848 --> 00:32:31.548
We're here. Go on in, Han.

00:32:31.748 --> 00:32:33.218
See you at school tomorrow.

00:32:33.288 --> 00:32:36.218
Bye, Ye On. Bye, Si On.

00:32:36.288 --> 00:32:37.288
Bye.

00:32:39.958 --> 00:32:41.798
- Shall we go home? - Okay.

00:32:49.238 --> 00:32:50.707
She took one look at me and said,

00:32:50.708 --> 00:32:52.338
"If I can't stand the sight of you, what other reason do I need?"

00:32:52.708 --> 00:32:53.708
Just like that.

00:32:55.608 --> 00:32:57.008
So you just left?

00:32:58.048 --> 00:32:59.748
What was I supposed to do? She couldn't stand the sight of me.

00:33:02.818 --> 00:33:03.818
Pillip.

00:33:05.018 --> 00:33:06.358
Do you hate the sight of Si On?

00:33:07.158 --> 00:33:09.188
- No. - Then go see her.

00:33:09.488 --> 00:33:10.488
What?

00:33:10.489 --> 00:33:13.128
Who needs a reason to see someone they like?

00:33:18.598 --> 00:33:19.598
Ye On.

00:33:20.368 --> 00:33:22.698
Aren't you at Han's place too often these days?

00:33:23.068 --> 00:33:24.908
His mom always invites me over.

00:33:26.438 --> 00:33:28.908
By the way, why doesn't Pillip come over anymore?

00:33:29.208 --> 00:33:30.248
Why would he come over?

00:33:30.348 --> 00:33:33.048
He visited us morning and night the other day.

00:33:33.118 --> 00:33:34.978
No, that's...

00:33:35.348 --> 00:33:39.758
- He only came because of Yong Pal. - So Pillip isn't your boyfriend?

00:33:40.258 --> 00:33:43.088
- Of course not! - Why not?

00:33:44.028 --> 00:33:45.028
Because he's not.

00:33:46.798 --> 00:33:49.928
- There's Pillip. - Stop messing with me.

00:33:50.268 --> 00:33:51.698
He's right over there.

00:33:52.468 --> 00:33:54.998
Pillip! Hey, Pillip!

00:33:55.368 --> 00:33:56.368
Hey, Ye On.

00:33:58.268 --> 00:33:59.938
- How've you been? - Good.

00:33:59.978 --> 00:34:01.078
Hey, Ye On, is your sister mad at me?

00:34:01.938 --> 00:34:04.708
Kind of. I'm not sure.

00:34:19.628 --> 00:34:20.628
What do you want?

00:34:22.458 --> 00:34:24.498
I heard you're not doing deliveries until after your exams.

00:34:25.768 --> 00:34:27.268
So I thought we could study together until then.

00:34:28.598 --> 00:34:29.668
I can do it myself.

00:34:30.538 --> 00:34:32.168
You said I'd pass just by studying the old tests.

00:34:32.468 --> 00:34:35.808
But tricky problems are easier if someone explains them.

00:34:36.078 --> 00:34:37.248
We could go to a study cafe together...

00:34:37.308 --> 00:34:39.448
Forget it. I'll just study at home.

00:34:41.578 --> 00:34:42.578
All right, then.

00:34:43.418 --> 00:34:44.418
Do whatever you're comfortable with.

00:34:48.358 --> 00:34:49.358
Si On.

So, who told them to just blindly sign the contract?

00:36:05.398 --> 00:36:07.667

Pillip, no woman can resist a man who can cook.

Besides, someone must run the kitchen when I'm not around.

00:45:45.808 --> 00:45:48.578

This is the art of negotiation, manipulating the choices.

You don't force the other person,

but you make them choose the path you've already laid out.

00:46:01.258 --> 00:46:02.898
So you're using that tactic on me right now?

00:46:02.998 --> 00:46:04.528
Not just any tactic.

00:46:05.498 --> 00:46:06.968

What?

This special powder stops the grease...

00:46:17.808 --> 00:46:19.278
and makes it crispy to the last bite.

00:46:22.878 --> 00:46:25.588
Besides, I've been working here way longer than you.

00:46:25.718 --> 00:46:27.088
But in the kitchen, I'm your senior.

00:46:28.158 --> 00:46:29.158
You're so annoying.

00:46:31.258 --> 00:46:33.028
Really? Seeing you always makes my day.

00:46:34.958 --> 00:46:36.128
And I like the sight of you.

00:46:36.698 --> 00:46:38.398
If I can't stand the sight of you, what other reason do I need?

00:46:50.878 --> 00:46:51.878
Here, have a taste.

00:46:53.448 --> 00:46:54.448

That's just the kind of guy I am. I even make a mean fried chicken.

00:47:13.868 --> 00:47:15.198
So what's the deal with that woman?

00:47:17.908 --> 00:47:21.608
I met her during my last case at the law firm.

- A client? - No.

00:47:26.208 --> 00:47:27.218
The opposing party.

00:47:28.318 --> 00:47:31.348
She was in a tough spot, but she lost the case.

00:47:33.518 --> 00:47:34.658
So why did she come here?

00:47:34.758 --> 00:47:37.118
Apparently, the gym hasn't paid her in six months.

00:47:37.288 --> 00:47:40.058
What? But why does she still work there?

00:47:40.388 --> 00:47:42.158
Because she has no choice but to stick it out.

00:47:43.258 --> 00:47:45.328
They keep promising to pay her but push it back,

00:47:45.428 --> 00:47:48.268
and stringing her along by promising a manager job at a branch abroad.

00:47:49.138 --> 00:47:50.868
She seemed like she had it all together.

00:47:51.108 --> 00:47:53.308
- Are you that dense? - What?

00:47:53.438 --> 00:47:55.578
You have no idea how amazing you are.

00:48:01.478 --> 00:48:02.478
Whatever...

00:48:11.358 --> 00:48:13.128
So that's how you're going to be?

00:48:14.528 --> 00:48:16.028
Hey, stop!

00:48:34.078 --> 00:48:36.278
(Gyeonggi Bukbu Police Agency)

00:48:43.818 --> 00:48:46.428
Why have you been watching the same footage since yesterday?

00:48:46.658 --> 00:48:47.898
Yesterday was Building 103.

00:48:48.328 --> 00:48:49.598
Today is Building 102.

00:48:57.908 --> 00:48:58.908
Yes.

00:49:01.478 --> 00:49:02.478
What?

00:49:03.908 --> 00:49:05.208
Okay. I'm on my way.

00:49:06.078 --> 00:49:07.618
Hey, what did you say you found?

00:49:07.778 --> 00:49:10.318
Why was your business card in Cha So Yeon's pocket?

00:49:11.818 --> 00:49:14.358
I'm not trying to make this difficult for you.

00:49:14.588 --> 00:49:15.758
Ma'am.

00:49:16.258 --> 00:49:18.228
I'll wait. So please, call me.

00:49:18.888 --> 00:49:21.198
What about her bag? Wasn't her bag at the scene?

00:49:21.298 --> 00:49:24.668
I clearly saw her put my card in her bag when I gave it to her.

00:49:24.798 --> 00:49:25.798
Detective Choi.

00:49:26.068 --> 00:49:27.868
That's not what's important right now.

00:49:27.938 --> 00:49:32.438
It is important. Did she try to call before she died?

00:49:32.668 --> 00:49:36.178
Hey, think about it. If she had, wouldn't that be strange?

00:49:37.208 --> 00:49:38.978
Hey, this might not be a suicide.

00:49:39.548 --> 00:49:41.078
My business card could be the evidence.

00:49:41.248 --> 00:49:44.288
What if they say she jumped because you kept harassing her?

00:49:44.818 --> 00:49:47.618
That card could make you the number one suspect.

00:49:47.888 --> 00:49:50.157
I already told everyone on our team to keep their mouths shut.

00:49:50.158 --> 00:49:54.028
What are you talking about? Darn it. I wasn't harassing anyone.

00:49:54.228 --> 00:49:57.327
I just wanted to talk for a bit, but she took a call and left.

00:49:57.328 --> 00:49:59.268
Check the CCTVs or any dashcams.

00:49:59.298 --> 00:50:01.198
I don't know. Just stay out of it. Please.

00:50:01.838 --> 00:50:02.898
Hey.

00:50:03.138 --> 00:50:05.808
Who was the last person Cha So Yeon spoke with?

00:50:06.368 --> 00:50:07.378
Detective Choi.

00:50:07.878 --> 00:50:10.578
This didn't happen at some small-time psychiatric hospital.

00:50:10.638 --> 00:50:13.308
This was at the Federal Medical Center.

00:50:13.378 --> 00:50:15.548
How much bigger does this need to be?

00:50:16.818 --> 00:50:17.848
Just drop it.

00:50:19.118 --> 00:50:22.118
Hey, Detective Kwak!

00:50:22.318 --> 00:50:23.358
Sir.

00:50:25.058 --> 00:50:28.758
I'm thinking the same thing with you.

00:50:28.828 --> 00:50:32.928
But you were transferred because of Yun Dong Hee, right?

00:50:32.998 --> 00:50:33.998
So what if I did?

00:50:35.198 --> 00:50:36.198
Never mind.

00:50:36.268 --> 00:50:38.568
Look. That punk is a wanted man,

00:50:38.608 --> 00:50:39.868
but he's not in the news at all.

00:50:40.208 --> 00:50:41.808
He was in the news 15 years ago,

00:50:41.878 --> 00:50:43.137
but now no one even knows his name.

00:50:43.138 --> 00:50:45.108
This whole thing is driving me crazy.

00:50:45.378 --> 00:50:46.578
Hey, just go on inside.

00:50:47.918 --> 00:50:51.848
Stop saying, "go inside." I'm your partner.

00:51:06.098 --> 00:51:09.798
When was the first deposit made into Yun Dong Hee's account?

00:51:09.868 --> 00:51:13.308
Twice in 2009, one month apart,

00:51:13.468 --> 00:51:14.478
and then this most recent one.

00:51:16.308 --> 00:51:17.808
So, three times in total.

00:51:18.408 --> 00:51:19.408
Is that it?

00:51:22.678 --> 00:51:26.648
There was no deposit on the day of Jun's incident.

00:51:29.888 --> 00:51:30.888
Mr. Shin.

00:51:31.788 --> 00:51:34.198
At the time, I was certain about my investigation.

00:51:35.558 --> 00:51:37.568
There's no way Yun Dong Hee could've done this alone.

00:51:37.628 --> 00:51:39.898
I've confirmed the million-dollar deposit.

00:51:40.398 --> 00:51:43.198
Who on earth is paying him that much money?

00:51:43.698 --> 00:51:47.608
An inmate escaped from the hospital shortly before my wife died.

00:51:47.878 --> 00:51:49.438
She was really stressed out after that.

00:51:49.738 --> 00:51:54.478
My wife was so worried about the Director getting in trouble.

00:51:55.048 --> 00:51:56.648
And I never even realized it.

00:52:07.228 --> 00:52:08.758
You're Detective Choi Cheol, right?

00:52:10.228 --> 00:52:11.228
You're the one who called me?

00:52:11.498 --> 00:52:15.498
- Yes. I was told you could help. - I've been expecting you.

00:52:15.838 --> 00:52:20.068
I gave Doctor Cha my business card that day.

00:52:20.138 --> 00:52:23.938
I was wondering if she was trying to call me.

00:52:24.008 --> 00:52:25.208
I was just curious.

00:52:25.308 --> 00:52:27.778
I don't think that's it.

00:52:28.148 --> 00:52:30.318
The last person my wife spoke with...

00:52:30.518 --> 00:52:31.988
was the director of the hospital.

00:52:32.488 --> 00:52:33.888
You mean Director Lee Heo Jun?

00:52:34.918 --> 00:52:36.158
From the Federal Medical Center?

00:52:36.258 --> 00:52:38.788
Yes. After he spoke with my wife that day,

00:52:39.258 --> 00:52:40.898
and then he called me right after.

00:52:40.998 --> 00:52:41.998
Yes.

00:52:41.999 --> 00:52:43.198
You need to go check on her now.

00:52:43.458 --> 00:52:45.028
I'm getting worried. I keep calling, but she's not picking up.

00:52:45.098 --> 00:52:46.228
I'll go up and check right now.

00:52:53.508 --> 00:52:55.978
Yes, hello. This is Detective Choi Cheol...

00:52:56.038 --> 00:52:57.548
from the Gyeonggi Bukbu Police Agency.

00:52:57.678 --> 00:52:59.348
Is Director Lee Heo Jun available?

00:53:01.578 --> 00:53:02.578
A meeting?

00:53:03.448 --> 00:53:06.318
Then please leave him a message to call me back.

00:53:06.648 --> 00:53:07.658
Okay.

00:53:07.718 --> 00:53:09.288
(Mr. Shin: Scent Café, Gwangok-dong, Inyeong-si)

00:53:09.358 --> 00:53:11.758
Okay, thank you.

00:53:41.443 --> 00:53:42.543
Detective Choi.

00:53:42.973 --> 00:53:45.613
On the day Yun Dong Hee's psychiatrist fell off the roof,

00:53:45.983 --> 00:53:47.453
one million dollars was deposited...

00:53:47.753 --> 00:53:49.353
into Yun Dong Hee's overseas account,

00:53:51.583 --> 00:53:54.353
But how did you know that?

00:53:59.893 --> 00:54:03.693
On October 11, 2009, and again on November 11,

00:54:04.163 --> 00:54:06.703
there are records of deposits made to the same account.

00:54:07.033 --> 00:54:08.473
October 11th.

00:54:10.033 --> 00:54:11.343

(Lee Han Jun Traffic Accident)

00:54:15.013 --> 00:54:16.013
Darn it.

00:54:17.243 --> 00:54:18.743
I knew it.

00:54:19.713 --> 00:54:21.413
Someone died in an accident that day.

00:54:22.283 --> 00:54:25.883
But it wasn't an accident. That case led me to Yun Dong Hee,

00:54:25.953 --> 00:54:26.953
Yun Dong Hee was after...

00:54:29.093 --> 00:54:32.063
Every time money is wired to Yun Dong Hee's account,

00:54:32.863 --> 00:54:34.863
someone loses their life.

00:54:35.533 --> 00:54:36.533
I suppose so.

00:54:37.703 --> 00:54:38.703
Mr. Shin.

00:54:39.963 --> 00:54:41.733
I'm going to stop it.

00:54:42.333 --> 00:54:43.633
I'll catch Yun Dong Hee,

00:54:44.003 --> 00:54:46.703
and I'll catch every single person behind him.

00:55:24.583 --> 00:55:26.043
Yes, this is Choi Cheol.

00:55:26.383 --> 00:55:27.813
I hear you called.

00:55:28.183 --> 00:55:30.353
This is Lee Heo Jun, Director of Federal Medical Center.

00:55:30.783 --> 00:55:32.453
Hello, Director Lee.

00:55:32.923 --> 00:55:36.953
I have a few questions for you. May I come by the hospital now?

00:55:38.063 --> 00:55:39.893
I'm actually on my way home right now.

00:55:39.963 --> 00:55:42.593
Then I'll just come to your home.

00:55:42.763 --> 00:55:45.003
- To my home? - It will only take a moment.

00:55:45.203 --> 00:55:46.233
All right, then.

00:55:46.963 --> 00:55:48.403
Let's meet briefly in front of my house.

00:55:48.473 --> 00:55:52.003
Got it. I'll head over right away. Could you text me the address?

00:55:52.143 --> 00:55:54.213
- Okay. - All right, see you soon.

00:56:07.493 --> 00:56:10.693
- Making a delivery? - No, this is for my parents.

00:56:10.863 --> 00:56:12.923
I'm taking this one to Ye On and my grandma.

00:56:13.123 --> 00:56:15.593
- Then what about the last one? - It's for Sun Mi.

00:56:15.693 --> 00:56:16.893
It was my idea to give it to her.

00:56:17.063 --> 00:56:20.732
Hey, I'm the owner here, and I bought all the ingredients,

00:56:20.733 --> 00:56:22.403
so why are you two taking all the credit?

00:56:24.103 --> 00:56:25.403
- But we made it! - But we made it!

00:56:25.473 --> 00:56:26.503
Si On.

00:56:26.843 --> 00:56:29.143
I expect it from him, but how could you...

00:56:30.013 --> 00:56:31.743
But you're the one who called me in.

00:56:33.113 --> 00:56:34.253
Unbelievable.

00:56:34.983 --> 00:56:37.683
I trusted you with my secret recipe so you could run the shop for me,

00:56:37.953 --> 00:56:39.453
and you're running it straight into the ground.

00:56:39.753 --> 00:56:41.023
We're going to fry it up and eat it.

00:56:41.453 --> 00:56:43.123
Make sure you clean the kitchen...

00:56:43.393 --> 00:56:44.893
and tidy this place up before you leave.

00:56:49.563 --> 00:56:50.793
You're off for the night, right?

00:56:51.133 --> 00:56:53.333
- Does it look like I'm coming in? - Have a good night.

00:56:55.533 --> 00:56:57.473
Let's clean up quick and go before the fried chicken gets cold.

00:56:57.773 --> 00:56:58.873
I'll take care of the kitchen.

00:57:11.623 --> 00:57:12.983
What do I do?

00:57:14.153 --> 00:57:15.293
What do I do?

00:57:20.493 --> 00:57:22.163
What do I do?

00:57:52.323 --> 00:57:55.063
- I'll be there in five minutes. - Don't worry. Go home and rest.

00:57:55.863 --> 00:57:59.233
Investigations are a two-person job. And I'm your partner,

00:57:59.363 --> 00:58:01.473
so from now on, I'll be your backup, sir.

00:58:01.533 --> 00:58:03.203
I'm telling you, you really don't have to come.

00:58:03.533 --> 00:58:05.573
So what are you planning to ask the hospital director?

00:58:05.673 --> 00:58:08.572
He was the last person she spoke to.

00:58:08.573 --> 00:58:10.243
I have to know what they talked about.

00:58:11.183 --> 00:58:14.213
I just passed the intersection. I'll be there in under ten minutes.

00:58:14.283 --> 00:58:15.913
Didn't you just say five minutes?

00:58:17.253 --> 00:58:18.823
Hey, I've got another call. I've got to go.

00:58:21.293 --> 00:58:23.493
Yes, Director, I'm here.

00:58:24.363 --> 00:58:27.363
Yes, I'll be by the streetlight.

00:59:12.973 --> 00:59:16.343
So, let's say I were to get colon cancer...

00:59:16.973 --> 00:59:19.383
Yes, sorry. I'll have to call you back.

00:59:19.443 --> 00:59:20.583
I'm busy right now.

00:59:34.763 --> 00:59:35.763
Move!

00:59:52.813 --> 00:59:54.243
You son of a witch.

01:00:17.073 --> 01:00:19.873
Hey, you! Call 911.

01:00:20.503 --> 01:00:22.613
Are you okay? No, don't try to move.

01:00:22.673 --> 01:00:23.673
Detective Choi.

01:00:27.983 --> 01:00:28.983
Wait...

01:00:32.823 --> 01:00:34.323
Open the door, you son of a witch!

01:00:38.123 --> 01:00:39.563
Somebody, please help!

01:00:42.893 --> 01:00:44.393
Open the darn door, you punk!

01:00:44.633 --> 01:00:45.833
Can you hear me?

01:00:58.783 --> 01:01:01.283
Open up, you punk!

01:01:31.283 --> 01:01:34.143
(Shin's Project)

01:01:34.653 --> 01:01:36.913
Why would Yun Dong Hee try to kill the director?

01:01:37.923 --> 01:01:40.583
I'm not going to sue him. What good would that even do?

01:01:40.653 --> 01:01:42.653
I mean, how would you even do that?

01:01:43.323 --> 01:01:45.223
Then who took it?

01:01:45.293 --> 01:01:48.263
A boss who takes his workers' pay to go on overseas trips.

01:01:48.693 --> 01:01:51.333
He must be incredibly shameless, right?

01:01:52.063 --> 01:01:53.732
Darn it. This is...

01:01:53.733 --> 01:01:56.933
When Mr. Shin is in danger, you have to stick right by his side.

01:01:59.073 --> 01:02:01.873
Stay out of sight, and just lie low.
