00:01:44.851 --> 00:01:47.410
(Adapted from the Jinjiang novel
"Light Beyond the Reed" by Mo Shubai)

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:51.220
=Episode 12=

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:54.980
Any plans after

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:56.180
the case ends?

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:58.050
Why do you ask?

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:00.620
It'd be like a rebirth.

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:02.300
Didn't you say

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:05.100
you wanted to do things that you wanted

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:06.620
but never got to do?

00:02:08.010 --> 00:02:08.940
I've thought about

00:02:09.533 --> 00:02:10.940
whether I should stay at Nancheng

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:13.100
or in other cities.

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:14.311
That would depend on Sibei.

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:20.890
There's something
I've been curious about.

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:23.660
If

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:25.660
you married someone else

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:27.380
instead of Ye Sibei,

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:31.570
could you accept this?

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:34.850
That's because

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:36.340
we've handled

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:37.380
a similar case.

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:39.060
In the end,

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:40.130
they won the case,

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:41.222
but lost their marriage.

00:02:42.177 --> 00:02:43.466
That won't happen to us.

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:49.730
You met through matchmaking, right?

00:02:51.111 --> 00:02:52.850
You've only been
married for a year or so,

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:55.220
and your relationship is so strong.

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:57.010
You knew her before?

00:02:57.010 --> 00:02:58.010
No.

00:02:58.660 --> 00:02:59.940
I didn't.

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:00.850
I'd never met her.

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:03.540
Really?

00:03:04.711 --> 00:03:06.010
Which school did you go to?

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:07.940
No. 7.

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:12.010
I guess not, then.

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:14.170
I was wondering if you two

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:16.290
were from the same school.

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:18.730
You'd have something in common,

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:20.220
or perhaps you'd met her before

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:21.410
but forgot about it.

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:22.466
But that's not the case.

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:25.450
No. 2 and No. 7 High School

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:26.980
are still pretty far apart.

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:34.820
Nan.

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:35.900
Captain Zhang.

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:38.500
How is it, Nianwen?

00:03:38.555 --> 00:03:39.660
Everything going well?

00:03:46.866 --> 00:03:48.533
Chuchu has changed her testimony.

00:03:48.622 --> 00:03:50.820
She said she didn't
give my sister the condom,

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:52.200
implying that it was my sister's.

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:09.610
Rise, everyone.

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:14.890
The People's Court

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:16.930
of Nancheng, Linjiang Province

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:18.340
(Defendant)
has reached a judgment.

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:29.100
After deliberation by a collegial panel,

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:31.250
which is then submitted to
the Adjudication Committee

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:32.511
for discussion of a proceeding

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:34.850
initiated by the
Public Prosecution Service,

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:35.810
the court finds that

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:36.650
the evidence against

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:39.490
the defendant,
Fan Jiancheng, is insufficient.

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:41.377
Therefore, the court finds the defendant

00:04:41.377 --> 00:04:42.220
not guilty of rape.

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:05.100
(Presiding Judge)

00:06:09.410 --> 00:06:10.220
Wenwen.

00:06:10.220 --> 00:06:11.290
You saw that?

00:06:11.290 --> 00:06:13.020
Daddy has been acquitted.

00:06:13.020 --> 00:06:13.780
He's a good person.

00:06:13.780 --> 00:06:15.290
He was framed.

00:06:15.290 --> 00:06:17.140
He will be home soon to see you.

00:06:17.140 --> 00:06:18.610
Yes, I'm innocent.

00:06:19.290 --> 00:06:20.660
I did nothing wrong.

00:06:21.540 --> 00:06:22.780
I want to thank the law

00:06:22.780 --> 00:06:25.290
and the court for proving my innocence.

00:06:25.980 --> 00:06:27.290
Of course, I must thank my wife

00:06:27.290 --> 00:06:28.111
for working so hard

00:06:28.133 --> 00:06:29.220
and staying by my side.

00:06:30.610 --> 00:06:32.020
As a father

00:06:33.020 --> 00:06:34.490
and a husband,

00:06:35.660 --> 00:06:38.410
I do have some imperfections.

00:06:40.220 --> 00:06:42.780
I hope that my case will set
an example for everyone,

00:06:42.780 --> 00:06:45.490
and I will be reflecting
deeply on my actions.

00:07:00.730 --> 00:07:01.900
You scumbag!

00:07:01.900 --> 00:07:03.170
What are you doing? Let go!

00:07:07.866 --> 00:07:09.410
Ye Sibei's family is assaulting him!

00:08:36.770 --> 00:08:37.770
Move!

00:08:37.770 --> 00:08:38.530
Let go!

00:08:38.530 --> 00:08:40.100
- Move!
- Let go of me!

00:08:40.100 --> 00:08:41.130
What are you doing?

00:08:44.650 --> 00:08:46.610
Get a hold of yourself!

00:08:46.770 --> 00:08:47.610
What are you doing?

00:08:47.980 --> 00:08:48.820
Let go of me!

00:08:49.100 --> 00:08:51.850
- Let go!
- Let go!

00:10:09.490 --> 00:10:10.420
That's enough.

00:10:10.420 --> 00:10:11.530
Don't get upset over this.

00:10:12.250 --> 00:10:14.180
I'm telling you, you're a cop.

00:10:14.490 --> 00:10:16.250
Don't get emotionally
involved in a case.

00:10:16.770 --> 00:10:17.940
Whatever you do,

00:10:18.155 --> 00:10:19.490
especially when handling a case,

00:10:19.770 --> 00:10:20.610
you...

00:10:22.010 --> 00:10:23.770
You can't let your emotions lead you.

00:10:23.770 --> 00:10:25.010
I know I'm a cop.

00:10:25.250 --> 00:10:26.130
But, Captain Zhang.

00:10:27.820 --> 00:10:29.010
I'm also human.

00:10:30.250 --> 00:10:32.460
Humans have a sense
of conscience, right?

00:10:41.580 --> 00:10:43.010
Still, the court must have

00:10:45.010 --> 00:10:46.490
their reason to deliver this verdict.

00:10:47.580 --> 00:10:48.420
I understand.

00:10:52.130 --> 00:10:53.250
Before I left the courthouse,

00:10:53.940 --> 00:10:55.250
I went to talk to Judge Gao.

00:10:59.220 --> 00:11:00.060
Judge Gao.

00:11:00.490 --> 00:11:01.060
Captain Zhang.

00:11:01.060 --> 00:11:02.150
Thank you for your hard work.

00:11:02.155 --> 00:11:02.730
You too.

00:11:03.250 --> 00:11:04.250
I have a question.

00:11:04.250 --> 00:11:05.610
Why did the court

00:11:05.610 --> 00:11:06.820
find him not guilty?

00:11:08.460 --> 00:11:09.300
I'm sorry.

00:11:10.340 --> 00:11:12.010
I know it has been hard on Ye Sibei.

00:11:12.490 --> 00:11:14.820
It requires immense courage
to take this step.

00:11:15.370 --> 00:11:16.580
However, as judges,

00:11:17.010 --> 00:11:19.580
we can only deliberate our verdict

00:11:19.580 --> 00:11:20.850
based on evidence and facts.

00:11:21.770 --> 00:11:23.130
We try our very best

00:11:23.666 --> 00:11:24.890
to ensure justice for all.

00:11:28.130 --> 00:11:29.890
Let me tell you about a case from 1999.

00:11:31.010 --> 00:11:33.820
A woman accused a man of raping her.

00:11:34.370 --> 00:11:36.820
While there were flaws
in the chain of evidence,

00:11:36.820 --> 00:11:37.890
basically,

00:11:37.890 --> 00:11:40.010
it made sense
that the man was the culprit.

00:11:40.444 --> 00:11:41.730
Besides, we used to prioritize

00:11:41.733 --> 00:11:42.940
statements and testimonies,

00:11:43.460 --> 00:11:45.580
and the woman wailed uncontrollably,

00:11:46.220 --> 00:11:48.711
so the man was jailed for 12 years.

00:11:49.370 --> 00:11:52.250
When he was released 12 years later,
he kept appealing his case

00:11:52.890 --> 00:11:54.622
and spent many years doing so,

00:11:55.130 --> 00:11:57.010
until a fugitive on the run

00:11:57.460 --> 00:11:59.250
admitted that he was the true culprit.

00:11:59.933 --> 00:12:01.610
That's how his innocence was restored.

00:12:02.770 --> 00:12:03.890
Who'd have expected

00:12:04.890 --> 00:12:07.250
that things would turn out this way?

00:12:08.940 --> 00:12:09.780
Judge Gao.

00:12:10.370 --> 00:12:12.180
He was jailed for 12 years,

00:12:13.266 --> 00:12:14.580
then spent years appealing.

00:12:15.010 --> 00:12:17.010
Wouldn't you say he wasted

00:12:17.010 --> 00:12:19.010
most of his life on this case?

00:12:19.480 --> 00:12:21.580
That's why we need to understand

00:12:22.240 --> 00:12:23.730
that once the law is violated,

00:12:23.730 --> 00:12:25.770
whether it's an aggrieved victim

00:12:25.770 --> 00:12:27.730
or an innocent man maligned,

00:12:27.730 --> 00:12:29.180
it would be incredibly tormenting.

00:12:29.730 --> 00:12:31.180
What we can do

00:12:31.180 --> 00:12:33.130
is to prepare sufficient evidence

00:12:33.130 --> 00:12:36.010
to explore what's closest to the truth.

00:12:36.010 --> 00:12:38.250
I believe you understand what I mean.

00:12:43.010 --> 00:12:44.730
It's tough being a judge.

00:12:50.890 --> 00:12:52.730
If you really care,

00:12:54.610 --> 00:12:56.010
keep investigating this case.

00:12:59.730 --> 00:13:00.610
This case

00:13:01.250 --> 00:13:02.090
isn't over.

00:14:01.700 --> 00:14:02.770
Wenwen!

00:14:06.820 --> 00:14:07.890
Wenwen!

00:14:08.850 --> 00:14:10.530
- Where's my daughter?
- Daddy!

00:14:10.530 --> 00:14:11.850
Daddy!

00:14:11.850 --> 00:14:13.730
- Wenwen!
- I missed you.

00:14:13.730 --> 00:14:15.300
You're finally back.

00:14:16.420 --> 00:14:17.980
I missed you.

00:14:18.420 --> 00:14:19.260
Let's hug it out.

00:14:19.980 --> 00:14:20.820
And a kiss.

00:14:22.650 --> 00:14:23.700
Not enough.

00:14:25.650 --> 00:14:26.940
My daughter is getting

00:14:26.940 --> 00:14:28.420
prettier by the day, isn't she?

00:14:30.850 --> 00:14:31.730
Daddy.

00:14:32.180 --> 00:14:35.490
They said you did something bad.

00:14:35.490 --> 00:14:36.840
Who said that?

00:14:36.850 --> 00:14:37.740
I'll slap them.

00:14:38.180 --> 00:14:39.360
I'm a good guy.

00:14:43.060 --> 00:14:44.980
More hugs from Daddy.

00:14:44.980 --> 00:14:46.300
Take her to bed.

00:14:47.700 --> 00:14:48.540
Go to bed.

00:14:48.770 --> 00:14:51.220
- I still want to play with Daddy.
- Go to bed.

00:14:52.060 --> 00:14:53.420
You can play tomorrow.

00:14:53.420 --> 00:14:54.730
Daddy's back.

00:14:55.060 --> 00:14:55.980
Wenwen!

00:14:55.980 --> 00:14:56.890
Now that I'm back,

00:14:56.890 --> 00:14:58.460
I can keep you company every day.

00:14:58.460 --> 00:14:59.980
Go to bed early,

00:14:59.980 --> 00:15:01.850
and we can play all day tomorrow,

00:15:01.850 --> 00:15:02.460
okay?

00:15:02.460 --> 00:15:03.300
Okay.

00:15:03.300 --> 00:15:04.580
Let me kiss my little princess.

00:15:06.370 --> 00:15:07.300
- There.
- Go to bed.

00:15:08.340 --> 00:15:09.250
Mommy.

00:15:10.100 --> 00:15:11.400
Good night. Go to bed.

00:15:11.400 --> 00:15:13.155
- Good night, Daddy and Mommy.
- Good night.

00:15:13.177 --> 00:15:14.000
Good night.

00:15:22.850 --> 00:15:23.730
Darling,

00:15:24.340 --> 00:15:25.100
you see...

00:15:25.100 --> 00:15:26.180
Don't touch me!

00:15:32.820 --> 00:15:33.660
You...

00:15:34.100 --> 00:15:36.180
You put something so dirty

00:15:36.180 --> 00:15:38.220
into my daughter's trophy.

00:15:38.220 --> 00:15:39.733
What's wrong with you?

00:15:40.340 --> 00:15:42.460
Mr. Fan has a message for you.

00:15:43.100 --> 00:15:44.580
He asked you to polish

00:15:44.580 --> 00:15:46.100
Wenwen's trophy.

00:15:54.460 --> 00:15:55.300
Do you know

00:15:56.340 --> 00:15:57.700
that you're standing here now

00:15:57.700 --> 00:15:58.540
because of me?

00:15:59.300 --> 00:16:00.140
If not for me,

00:16:00.530 --> 00:16:02.100
you'd still be in jail now!

00:16:05.130 --> 00:16:05.970
Yes.

00:16:09.730 --> 00:16:10.570
It's my fault.

00:16:12.730 --> 00:16:14.130
I'm sorry, Darling.

00:16:21.180 --> 00:16:23.444
Thank you for doing me
such a huge favor.

00:16:25.130 --> 00:16:26.430
I promise that in the future,

00:16:27.100 --> 00:16:29.100
I'll treat you and Wenwen well.

00:16:29.640 --> 00:16:30.850
Everything in the house,

00:16:30.850 --> 00:16:31.850
the house, the car,

00:16:31.850 --> 00:16:33.420
my money, as long as you want them,

00:16:33.420 --> 00:16:34.530
they're all yours.

00:16:36.300 --> 00:16:37.140
Don't be angry.

00:16:40.460 --> 00:16:42.340
I let you come back

00:16:42.340 --> 00:16:44.180
so that you can be a good father.

00:16:46.130 --> 00:16:47.220
From now on,

00:16:47.980 --> 00:16:49.180
you're on your own.

00:16:54.820 --> 00:16:55.660
So...

00:16:57.533 --> 00:16:58.570
About the USB drive...

00:17:02.300 --> 00:17:03.140
The USB drive?

00:17:09.730 --> 00:17:10.570
You will never know

00:17:12.860 --> 00:17:14.980
where the USB drive is.

00:17:29.420 --> 00:17:31.050
(Headlines)
Please briefly tell us

00:17:31.050 --> 00:17:32.180
what happened that day.

00:17:34.460 --> 00:17:36.570
That night, both of us drank alcohol.

00:17:36.570 --> 00:17:38.220
We went back home together.

00:17:38.220 --> 00:17:39.733
My house was just ten minutes away,

00:17:39.733 --> 00:17:40.730
so I got there first.

00:17:42.140 --> 00:17:43.980
Before I left, I reminded her

00:17:44.622 --> 00:17:46.555
to send me a message
once she reached home.

00:17:48.050 --> 00:17:49.180
When you got down,

00:17:49.180 --> 00:17:51.220
was the victim in a clear state of mind?

00:17:53.530 --> 00:17:55.420
We chatted in the car.

00:17:56.730 --> 00:17:57.730
(Both of us were)

00:17:58.810 --> 00:17:59.810
(a little tipsy,)

00:18:00.330 --> 00:18:01.860
(but still pretty much sane.)

00:18:02.290 --> 00:18:03.330
(What did you chat about?)

00:18:04.220 --> 00:18:05.860
(She said life is too hard,)

00:18:06.980 --> 00:18:09.570
(and I told her to keep
moving forward regardless.)

00:18:09.570 --> 00:18:10.570
That means

00:18:10.570 --> 00:18:12.530
you didn't abandon her.

00:18:17.530 --> 00:18:19.290
Only both of us were in the car.

00:18:20.730 --> 00:18:22.420
Based on what you say,

00:18:22.420 --> 00:18:24.290
if I were the one who lived further,

00:18:24.290 --> 00:18:26.290
I'd have been the victim,

00:18:26.290 --> 00:18:28.420
and she'd have been the one
who abandoned me, right?

00:18:30.180 --> 00:18:31.420
You're saying that

00:18:31.980 --> 00:18:35.300
either of us could've been
at fault, right?

00:18:36.140 --> 00:18:37.330
Did she send you a message

00:18:37.330 --> 00:18:38.250
when she reached home?

00:18:43.050 --> 00:18:45.140
All I can say is that
I made sure she was safe

00:18:45.140 --> 00:18:46.140
before I slept.

00:18:46.711 --> 00:18:48.810
(I don't feel like answering
this question anymore.)

00:18:49.177 --> 00:18:50.420
(It's been said that the victim)

00:18:50.420 --> 00:18:51.050
took a loan out

00:18:51.050 --> 00:18:53.220
to buy a house for you and her brother.

00:18:53.220 --> 00:18:54.730
Did you know about this before?

00:18:54.730 --> 00:18:55.570
No.

00:18:56.420 --> 00:18:57.380
Our families

00:18:57.380 --> 00:18:59.010
got together to discuss our marriage.

00:18:59.930 --> 00:19:01.420
At first, my father requested for

00:19:01.420 --> 00:19:02.710
a bride price and a house.

00:19:03.230 --> 00:19:05.330
His family replied that they're not

00:19:05.330 --> 00:19:07.177
well off, and they
can't afford the bride price,

00:19:07.200 --> 00:19:08.420
so they'll just buy us a house

00:19:08.420 --> 00:19:10.050
under my name and her brother's.

00:19:10.050 --> 00:19:11.533
Both of us would pay the house loan.

00:19:12.220 --> 00:19:14.490
I always thought the down payment

00:19:14.490 --> 00:19:16.420
came from her brother's parents.

00:19:18.140 --> 00:19:19.940
If I'd known Ye Sibei paid for it,

00:19:20.810 --> 00:19:21.980
I would've rejected.

00:19:25.580 --> 00:19:27.180
Now, because of this lawsuit,

00:19:29.140 --> 00:19:30.380
we sold the house.

00:19:32.730 --> 00:19:33.900
From now on, I have...

00:19:40.180 --> 00:19:41.730
I have nothing to do with his family.

00:19:49.940 --> 00:19:51.140
Nianwen, where are you going?

00:19:52.200 --> 00:19:53.040
Nianwen!

00:19:58.140 --> 00:19:59.180
What did she say?

00:20:00.730 --> 00:20:02.180
What did she say?

00:20:08.980 --> 00:20:10.380
She said you were awake.

00:20:11.250 --> 00:20:12.380
What, awake?

00:20:13.140 --> 00:20:14.420
She said that when she left,

00:20:14.420 --> 00:20:16.050
you could still talk normally

00:20:16.050 --> 00:20:16.980
and recognize people,

00:20:16.980 --> 00:20:18.822
and you were still
in a clear state of mind.

00:20:18.980 --> 00:20:20.730
She said that when she got down,

00:20:20.730 --> 00:20:23.133
she asked you to send her a message
once you reach home,

00:20:23.250 --> 00:20:25.490
and she only slept after
she made sure you were safe.

00:20:27.155 --> 00:20:29.488
She also said it wasn't her
who gave you the condom.

00:21:16.355 --> 00:21:17.220
Dad, I'm going out.

00:21:17.220 --> 00:21:18.770
I won't be having dinner.

00:21:19.140 --> 00:21:19.980
Okay.

00:21:40.980 --> 00:21:41.820
I...

00:21:42.460 --> 00:21:43.010
Take it easy.

00:21:43.010 --> 00:21:44.980
It's raining.
Why didn't you bring an umbrella?

00:21:47.770 --> 00:21:49.940
It wasn't raining yet
when I left the house.

00:21:49.940 --> 00:21:51.660
You could've taken shelter somewhere.

00:21:52.050 --> 00:21:53.660
I can see your house from here.

00:21:53.660 --> 00:21:55.180
If I go elsewhere,

00:21:55.180 --> 00:21:56.250
I can't see you coming out.

00:21:57.140 --> 00:21:57.770
You...

00:21:57.770 --> 00:21:59.570
We agreed to meet at the cinema, right?

00:21:59.980 --> 00:22:02.730
It's a 15-minute walk
from here to the cinema.

00:22:04.010 --> 00:22:05.666
I can't wait that long.

00:22:06.900 --> 00:22:08.380
What's with the rush?

00:22:08.380 --> 00:22:09.900
You can't even wait for 15 minutes?

00:22:12.730 --> 00:22:14.180
What do you think

00:22:14.940 --> 00:22:16.140
of me?

00:22:17.810 --> 00:22:19.010
You're a good guy.

00:22:20.330 --> 00:22:21.900
Is that a rejection?

00:22:25.355 --> 00:22:26.570
Fine.

00:22:26.980 --> 00:22:27.820
It's okay.

00:22:28.420 --> 00:22:31.010
But there's something I need to say.

00:22:36.140 --> 00:22:36.980
Chuchu.

00:22:38.140 --> 00:22:39.010
I like you.

00:22:40.730 --> 00:22:41.730
I know that you

00:22:41.730 --> 00:22:44.180
may not feel the same way now,

00:22:44.180 --> 00:22:45.460
but don't stress over it.

00:22:45.460 --> 00:22:46.770
I'm happy to be with you,

00:22:47.330 --> 00:22:48.900
going shopping together,

00:22:48.900 --> 00:22:49.740
and watching a movie.

00:22:49.980 --> 00:22:50.980
As long as you want it,

00:22:50.980 --> 00:22:51.820
I can do anything.

00:22:52.980 --> 00:22:54.420
Actually,

00:22:54.420 --> 00:22:55.770
just being with you

00:22:56.490 --> 00:22:57.660
already makes me happy.

00:22:59.730 --> 00:23:00.570
Is that so?

00:23:01.460 --> 00:23:02.980
You're not expecting a reply?

00:23:04.140 --> 00:23:05.700
Instead of getting rejected,

00:23:06.180 --> 00:23:09.140
not getting a reply
means I still have hope.

00:23:13.810 --> 00:23:15.460
I don't need a shopping buddy.

00:23:16.900 --> 00:23:18.180
What I need is a boyfriend.

00:23:25.900 --> 00:23:26.740
What?

00:23:27.770 --> 00:23:28.770
Chuchu!

00:23:28.770 --> 00:23:29.660
I can do that!

00:23:30.140 --> 00:23:31.250
Of course, I can!

00:23:31.250 --> 00:23:32.940
What can you do?

00:23:33.330 --> 00:23:34.810
I can be your boyfriend.

00:23:48.220 --> 00:23:50.420
Ye Nianwen loves Chuchu.

00:23:51.010 --> 00:23:53.180
Chuchu loves Ye Nianwen.

00:24:50.940 --> 00:24:51.780
You're here.

00:24:53.420 --> 00:24:54.570
Why did you lie?

00:24:56.220 --> 00:24:57.180
Lie about what?

00:24:58.570 --> 00:25:00.700
You lied in court!

00:25:05.733 --> 00:25:07.530
Take your phone and recording pen out.

00:25:10.050 --> 00:25:11.420
Who do you think I am?

00:25:15.420 --> 00:25:16.660
I know you too well.

00:25:18.570 --> 00:25:19.420
Take them out.

00:25:26.488 --> 00:25:27.730
I'm grabbing your collar.

00:25:27.730 --> 00:25:28.909
I'm threatening the witness.

00:25:28.910 --> 00:25:30.933
Even if I were recording,
it wouldn't be admissible.

00:25:32.022 --> 00:25:33.220
Let's talk about it at home.

00:25:55.420 --> 00:25:56.770
Take your coat off.

00:25:56.770 --> 00:25:57.660
Take your phone out.

00:25:57.660 --> 00:25:58.730
Empty your pockets.

00:26:03.780 --> 00:26:05.020
(The World Never Disappoints
Anyone Who Works Hard)

00:26:06.900 --> 00:26:07.740
Is this good enough?

00:26:13.770 --> 00:26:14.660
Hi, Dad.

00:26:15.380 --> 00:26:16.220
Chuchu.

00:26:16.660 --> 00:26:19.090
Sibei and Qin Nan are here for you.

00:26:19.090 --> 00:26:19.940
Let them come in.

00:26:26.460 --> 00:26:27.700
Ask away.

00:26:37.250 --> 00:26:38.700
Why did you lie?

00:26:41.180 --> 00:26:42.220
When I was in court,

00:26:44.140 --> 00:26:45.860
other than what I said about the condom,

00:26:47.355 --> 00:26:48.900
I didn't lie about anything else.

00:27:00.490 --> 00:27:01.700
I didn't lie.

00:27:04.333 --> 00:27:06.770
That night, Zheng Qiang insisted
on drinking with everyone.

00:27:07.900 --> 00:27:08.900
He's a good drinker.

00:27:08.900 --> 00:27:10.860
I drank for a while and got tipsy.

00:27:11.700 --> 00:27:13.090
Fan Jiancheng saw me,

00:27:13.090 --> 00:27:14.700
and he asked me to tend to you

00:27:14.700 --> 00:27:16.420
so that we could
avoid drinking together.

00:27:17.250 --> 00:27:19.420
That's why I trusted him that night.

00:27:20.180 --> 00:27:21.700
I thought he was a good man.

00:27:22.460 --> 00:27:24.090
Actually, after you vomited that night,

00:27:24.730 --> 00:27:26.660
you were pretty much the same as usual.

00:27:27.140 --> 00:27:28.330
Perhaps you were emotional

00:27:28.330 --> 00:27:29.170
and talkative,

00:27:29.577 --> 00:27:31.090
but you could still talk clearly

00:27:31.090 --> 00:27:32.330
and recognize people.

00:27:33.140 --> 00:27:35.090
We kept chatting in the car, too.

00:27:36.140 --> 00:27:37.900
You asked me why life is so hard.

00:27:38.980 --> 00:27:40.090
I replied,

00:27:41.090 --> 00:27:42.980
there's no end to challenges in life.

00:27:43.700 --> 00:27:45.330
We can only move forward.

00:27:46.900 --> 00:27:47.740
I remember that.

00:27:48.180 --> 00:27:49.490
After I got down, I told you

00:27:49.490 --> 00:27:50.555
to call me when you get home

00:27:50.577 --> 00:27:51.755
to let me know you're safe.

00:27:52.220 --> 00:27:54.140
When I got home, I was so tired,

00:27:54.140 --> 00:27:55.900
so I set an alarm for one hour

00:27:55.900 --> 00:27:57.380
and went to sleep.

00:27:57.933 --> 00:27:58.730
When I woke up,

00:27:58.730 --> 00:27:59.810
I saw your message

00:27:59.810 --> 00:28:00.860
telling me that you've

00:28:00.860 --> 00:28:01.900
reached home,

00:28:02.730 --> 00:28:03.700
so I didn't think much

00:28:03.700 --> 00:28:05.140
and went back to sleep.

00:28:05.940 --> 00:28:06.780
Where's the message?

00:28:07.090 --> 00:28:07.930
Show me the message.

00:28:21.060 --> 00:28:23.780
(Location Pin: Jinxiu Residential Area
I'm home.)

00:28:26.022 --> 00:28:27.555
It must've been Fan Jiancheng.

00:28:27.730 --> 00:28:29.050
Fan Jiancheng drove my sister

00:28:29.050 --> 00:28:29.940
to her apartment,

00:28:30.222 --> 00:28:32.660
and sent this message with her phone
before deleting it.

00:28:32.660 --> 00:28:33.900
And the call too.

00:28:33.900 --> 00:28:35.511
He made the call,
then deleted the record.

00:28:35.980 --> 00:28:36.820
It was past midnight.

00:28:37.044 --> 00:28:38.330
Sibei was already unconscious.

00:28:39.700 --> 00:28:40.490
At first, I was

00:28:40.490 --> 00:28:42.250
determined to help Sibei.

00:28:43.140 --> 00:28:44.700
That's why I did whatever you told me.

00:28:45.555 --> 00:28:47.180
I didn't show this message
to the police.

00:28:48.010 --> 00:28:49.460
You said you were unconscious,

00:28:50.660 --> 00:28:52.010
so I left it at that.

00:28:52.010 --> 00:28:53.860
Why did you change your testimony, then?

00:28:54.266 --> 00:28:55.288
Why did you say

00:28:55.333 --> 00:28:56.977
you didn't give Sibei the condom?

00:28:59.700 --> 00:29:00.770
You're lying.

00:29:00.770 --> 00:29:02.140
You must be lying!

00:29:08.140 --> 00:29:09.866
I've been having dreams lately.

00:29:11.660 --> 00:29:12.420
I saw us

00:29:12.420 --> 00:29:14.090
trapped inside a cage,

00:29:14.940 --> 00:29:16.250
surrounded by people with sticks

00:29:16.250 --> 00:29:18.380
and knives, threatening us.

00:29:19.330 --> 00:29:20.700
They wanted me to bite you,

00:29:21.133 --> 00:29:22.690
and then asked you to do the same to me.

00:29:25.090 --> 00:29:26.700
They said we're both sinners.

00:29:27.177 --> 00:29:28.180
We did something wrong,

00:29:28.955 --> 00:29:30.770
so we need to be punished.

00:29:31.940 --> 00:29:32.770
But I've been

00:29:32.770 --> 00:29:33.980
wondering what I did wrong.

00:29:35.380 --> 00:29:36.860
I shouldn't have worked in sales.

00:29:37.466 --> 00:29:39.333
I shouldn't have gone
to social gatherings.

00:29:39.570 --> 00:29:40.530
I should've called

00:29:40.530 --> 00:29:41.490
my family.

00:29:41.490 --> 00:29:43.330
I should've sent you home that night.

00:29:44.420 --> 00:29:45.900
Every day, I ask myself

00:29:46.490 --> 00:29:48.090
why I didn't do all that.

00:29:49.900 --> 00:29:51.490
Why did I trust someone so easily?

00:29:52.940 --> 00:29:54.460
Why didn't I call my family

00:29:54.460 --> 00:29:56.660
to let them pick us up that night?

00:29:56.660 --> 00:29:58.140
Why did I choose to work in sales

00:29:58.140 --> 00:29:59.770
just for a measly income?

00:30:00.250 --> 00:30:01.180
Why did I

00:30:01.180 --> 00:30:02.380
leave you alone

00:30:02.380 --> 00:30:04.460
in the car that night?

00:30:07.380 --> 00:30:09.180
How could I be so bad?

00:30:10.460 --> 00:30:12.860
How could I be so bad?

00:30:15.570 --> 00:30:16.220
But I don't have

00:30:16.220 --> 00:30:17.980
the courage to be good.

00:30:19.090 --> 00:30:21.420
It's too difficult to be
good in this world.

00:30:21.420 --> 00:30:22.260
I can't do it.

00:30:23.700 --> 00:30:25.860
I admit, I'm a little selfish.

00:30:26.940 --> 00:30:27.780
I'm unrestrained,

00:30:28.660 --> 00:30:29.940
I'm incorrigible, yes.

00:30:32.900 --> 00:30:34.900
But at least that makes me live better.

00:30:39.180 --> 00:30:40.460
That's how everyone is,

00:30:41.700 --> 00:30:42.770
so I'll just follow suit.

00:30:44.010 --> 00:30:45.860
I already know that people think of me

00:30:46.220 --> 00:30:47.460
as a money digger

00:30:49.420 --> 00:30:50.900
who forced my boyfriend to buy a house

00:30:50.900 --> 00:30:52.511
and suck his sister's blood dry.

00:30:56.460 --> 00:30:57.770
If those people knew it was me

00:30:57.770 --> 00:30:59.250
who gave Sibei the condom,

00:31:01.420 --> 00:31:02.220
I can't imagine

00:31:02.220 --> 00:31:04.140
what they would say about me.

00:31:04.700 --> 00:31:05.940
They'd say,

00:31:05.940 --> 00:31:06.940
"Look at that girl,

00:31:06.940 --> 00:31:08.570
wearing stockings and high heels,

00:31:08.570 --> 00:31:10.330
she must be a whore.

00:31:11.140 --> 00:31:11.980
If she has a condom,

00:31:11.980 --> 00:31:13.420
does that mean she..."

00:31:17.770 --> 00:31:18.610
I'm sorry.

00:31:23.044 --> 00:31:24.140
I can't take it anymore.

00:31:31.010 --> 00:31:31.860
Let's go.

00:31:32.700 --> 00:31:34.090
I haven't finished asking.

00:31:36.860 --> 00:31:37.940
Let's leave it at here.

00:31:43.730 --> 00:31:44.570
Chuchu.

00:31:47.660 --> 00:31:48.700
You're not bad.

00:31:50.700 --> 00:31:52.090
Don't be a bad person, ever.

00:31:59.250 --> 00:32:02.180
All I cared about was seeking
justice for myself,

00:32:04.220 --> 00:32:05.940
and I had neglected your situation.

00:32:10.140 --> 00:32:10.980
Goodbye.

00:32:37.140 --> 00:32:38.250
- Sibei...
- Sibei!

00:32:38.250 --> 00:32:39.140
- Sibei.
- Sibei!

00:32:45.490 --> 00:32:46.730
Stop pursuing this case.

00:32:47.180 --> 00:32:48.180
I'll give you the money.

00:32:49.420 --> 00:32:51.140
I'll give you all my money.

00:32:51.140 --> 00:32:52.420
Go to the capital

00:32:52.420 --> 00:32:54.250
and start a new life.

00:32:55.660 --> 00:32:56.980
Stop pursuing this.

00:32:57.940 --> 00:32:59.660
I'm sorry.

00:33:00.380 --> 00:33:01.490
I'm sorry.

00:33:02.380 --> 00:33:05.770
I'm sorry.

00:33:09.420 --> 00:33:10.420
I understand.

00:33:12.250 --> 00:33:13.090
I don't blame you.

00:33:16.700 --> 00:33:18.700
It wasn't your intention.

00:33:21.140 --> 00:33:22.490
Lead a good life

00:33:23.533 --> 00:33:24.911
and take care of yourself.

00:33:27.490 --> 00:33:28.330
Sibei.

00:33:29.900 --> 00:33:30.740
I'm sorry.

00:33:31.490 --> 00:33:32.420
I'm sorry.

00:33:32.770 --> 00:33:33.700
I'm sorry.

00:33:34.490 --> 00:33:35.330
I'm sorry.

00:33:37.770 --> 00:33:38.610
Sibei.

00:33:39.700 --> 00:33:40.980
I'm sorry.

00:33:46.700 --> 00:33:47.540
I'm sorry.

00:33:49.140 --> 00:33:49.980
Sibei.

00:33:51.420 --> 00:33:52.260
I'm sorry.

00:34:03.860 --> 00:34:04.700
Sibei!

00:34:05.090 --> 00:34:06.090
I'm sorry!

00:34:31.780 --> 00:34:33.130
Why are we leaving?

00:34:36.130 --> 00:34:38.340
She lied. She affected
the judges' decision.

00:34:38.340 --> 00:34:40.170
This case shouldn't
have ended like this.

00:34:45.170 --> 00:34:46.780
It was Fan Jiancheng who harmed me.

00:34:46.780 --> 00:34:48.490
She's a key witness.

00:34:48.490 --> 00:34:50.460
Her statement caused you a disadvantage!

00:34:50.460 --> 00:34:52.266
So what if you knew that
it was Fan Jiancheng

00:34:52.288 --> 00:34:53.170
who did this to you?

00:34:57.010 --> 00:34:58.010
I'm sorry, Nianwen.

00:35:00.050 --> 00:35:01.170
I messed up your life.

00:35:03.260 --> 00:35:05.090
Sibei, no, I...

00:35:05.690 --> 00:35:07.010
Let's end it now.

00:35:09.260 --> 00:35:10.780
Everyone has sacrificed too much.

00:35:10.780 --> 00:35:11.690
Sibei.

00:35:11.690 --> 00:35:13.780
We can still appeal to the prosecution.

00:35:13.780 --> 00:35:15.044
We can have a second hearing.

00:35:17.530 --> 00:35:19.050
There are too many people involved.

00:35:21.090 --> 00:35:22.170
I'm out of energy.

00:35:41.570 --> 00:35:42.410
Go home.

00:35:43.533 --> 00:35:44.780
Don't make your sister worry.

00:36:33.740 --> 00:36:35.090
You're really not going to appeal?

00:36:35.900 --> 00:36:36.780
No.

00:36:38.420 --> 00:36:39.260
Can you accept this?

00:36:40.570 --> 00:36:41.980
What's not to accept?

00:36:42.740 --> 00:36:44.090
We've already made it this far.

00:36:45.130 --> 00:36:46.570
We made it this far.

00:36:48.980 --> 00:36:51.940
Throughout this journey,
I've received a lot.

00:36:52.780 --> 00:36:54.570
I know I'm not alone.

00:36:56.940 --> 00:36:58.780
Life has to continue.

00:36:59.820 --> 00:37:01.570
We have to look forward, right?

00:37:10.570 --> 00:37:11.410
Okay.

00:37:12.460 --> 00:37:13.570
I'll be with you.

00:37:15.570 --> 00:37:16.900
Let's move forward together.

00:37:23.570 --> 00:37:25.380
I'm happy to hear that.

00:37:27.380 --> 00:37:28.220
Sibei.

00:37:29.530 --> 00:37:31.090
But don't you think

00:37:31.090 --> 00:37:31.780
it's a pity...

00:37:31.780 --> 00:37:32.820
Let's go home.

00:37:33.680 --> 00:37:35.130
I'm really sleepy.

00:38:31.340 --> 00:38:32.180
Sibei.

00:38:35.420 --> 00:38:36.780
I made you chicken soup.

00:38:37.780 --> 00:38:38.780
Drink some.

00:38:39.170 --> 00:38:40.940
You haven't eaten for days.

00:38:40.940 --> 00:38:41.980
You need to drink some.

00:38:43.130 --> 00:38:44.170
I don't want to.

00:38:47.311 --> 00:38:49.300
Our local hospital
has limited resources.

00:38:49.777 --> 00:38:51.130
They couldn't diagnose anything.

00:38:52.050 --> 00:38:52.740
Why don't we just

00:38:52.740 --> 00:38:53.900
go to the city hospital?

00:38:54.780 --> 00:38:56.940
I'm exhausted, that's all.

00:38:58.050 --> 00:38:59.860
I just need more sleep.

00:38:59.860 --> 00:39:00.900
Listen to me, then.

00:39:01.780 --> 00:39:02.650
Drink some soup,

00:39:03.000 --> 00:39:05.355
or else I'll have to carry you
to the city hospital.

00:39:29.260 --> 00:39:30.650
I don't want to drink.

00:39:32.090 --> 00:39:33.010
One more mouthful.

00:39:35.090 --> 00:39:35.930
No.

00:39:47.740 --> 00:39:48.690
Hello, Jun?

00:39:48.690 --> 00:39:49.340
Nan.

00:39:49.340 --> 00:39:51.130
There's a guy at the workshop

00:39:51.130 --> 00:39:52.420
who insists that you fix his car.

00:39:53.050 --> 00:39:53.890
Go.

00:39:54.810 --> 00:39:56.288
- Okay, got it.
- Great.

00:40:01.650 --> 00:40:02.650
I'm going, then.

00:40:03.380 --> 00:40:04.570
I'll leave the soup here.

00:40:05.650 --> 00:40:06.820
Remember to drink some.

00:40:24.260 --> 00:40:25.170
Sorry

00:40:25.170 --> 00:40:26.010
for the delay.

00:40:26.260 --> 00:40:27.340
You're Qin Nan?

00:40:29.044 --> 00:40:30.380
What's wrong with your car?

00:40:30.900 --> 00:40:31.860
It's...

00:40:31.860 --> 00:40:33.090
There's a smoky smell,

00:40:33.090 --> 00:40:34.780
and the warning lights are on,

00:40:34.780 --> 00:40:35.780
so please take a look.

00:41:18.940 --> 00:41:19.780
What are you doing?

00:41:19.940 --> 00:41:20.860
Who let you do that?

00:41:20.860 --> 00:41:22.050
Give it back! It's mine!

00:41:22.088 --> 00:41:23.888
- Who let you do that?
- Give my phone back!

00:41:25.380 --> 00:41:27.260
What are you up to?
I knew you were fishy.

00:41:27.400 --> 00:41:28.570
Who let you take these photos?

00:41:28.570 --> 00:41:29.570
I'm just recording my life.

00:41:29.570 --> 00:41:31.220
(Delete)
What do you mean by that?

00:41:31.688 --> 00:41:33.170
What kind of life are you recording?

00:41:33.170 --> 00:41:34.780
More like violating privacy, you know?

00:41:34.780 --> 00:41:35.650
No.

00:41:35.650 --> 00:41:36.380
Stop recording.

00:41:36.380 --> 00:41:37.220
Stop.

00:41:37.380 --> 00:41:38.420
I'll be honest.

00:41:38.955 --> 00:41:41.044
I have over 300,000 followers
on social media.

00:41:41.088 --> 00:41:43.622
I know he's in trouble,
so I'm helping him to clear his name.

00:41:43.820 --> 00:41:44.570
Do you think

00:41:44.570 --> 00:41:45.690
he needs your help?

00:41:45.690 --> 00:41:46.780
I have over 300,000 followers.

00:41:46.780 --> 00:41:48.260
I've got social influence.

00:41:48.260 --> 00:41:49.170
I can help him.

00:41:50.570 --> 00:41:51.410
Hello.

00:41:51.755 --> 00:41:53.355
Do you still need to fix your car?

00:41:55.130 --> 00:41:56.050
Go ahead.

00:41:56.266 --> 00:41:57.377
I'm already here, anyway.

00:41:57.688 --> 00:41:59.420
If you want to fix your car,
I can do it.

00:42:00.780 --> 00:42:01.780
But stop taking photos.

00:42:18.500 --> 00:42:19.340
Nan.

00:42:19.900 --> 00:42:20.820
What's your plan now?

00:42:22.060 --> 00:42:22.900
What do you mean?

00:42:24.940 --> 00:42:26.700
You were about to file
for divorce, right?

00:42:28.060 --> 00:42:29.740
Then, your wife got into trouble.

00:42:30.300 --> 00:42:31.540
As decent people,

00:42:31.577 --> 00:42:32.600
we're obligated to help

00:42:32.820 --> 00:42:34.860
if someone is in trouble.

00:42:35.820 --> 00:42:38.020
But it's already over, right?

00:42:38.020 --> 00:42:39.100
The court's verdict is out.

00:42:40.355 --> 00:42:42.300
The court's verdict
might not be the truth.

00:42:47.180 --> 00:42:48.220
Think again, will you?

00:42:49.780 --> 00:42:51.700
You haven't been married for long.

00:42:52.540 --> 00:42:54.140
Do you really know her that well?

00:42:57.820 --> 00:42:58.700
I know her.

00:43:00.100 --> 00:43:01.300
More than anyone else does.

00:43:02.820 --> 00:43:03.660
I trust her.

00:43:06.500 --> 00:43:08.380
Since you trust her, I believe in you.

00:43:08.380 --> 00:43:09.700
If anyone dares to say

00:43:09.700 --> 00:43:11.380
anything rotten about you,

00:43:11.380 --> 00:43:12.420
I'll chase them all away.

00:43:35.100 --> 00:43:35.820
Hey, Mom.

00:43:35.820 --> 00:43:36.540
Qin Nan.

00:43:36.540 --> 00:43:37.540
When are you free?

00:43:37.540 --> 00:43:39.020
Can you come over?

00:43:39.020 --> 00:43:39.540
Don't panic.

00:43:39.540 --> 00:43:40.488
Tell me what happened.

00:43:40.740 --> 00:43:42.140
I need to talk to you.

00:43:42.140 --> 00:43:43.540
Just come over.

00:43:43.540 --> 00:43:44.140
Okay, got it.

00:43:44.140 --> 00:43:44.980
I'll be right over.

00:43:46.340 --> 00:43:47.540
Jun, I need to go.

00:43:47.755 --> 00:43:48.933
Take care of the workshop.
