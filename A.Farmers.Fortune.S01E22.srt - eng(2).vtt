(Qingqing Self-Service Hotpot)

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:26.280
Fengyang House has reopened for business.

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:27.560
The preparations are underway.

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:31.200
Money is flowing out like water.

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:32.520
Qingqing.

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:34.680
Something big has happened.

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:36.880
The Village Chief just sent word.

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:37.800
A distinguished guest

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:39.200
asked to meet you, the shop owner.

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:41.440
They say he comes from the Capital.

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:43.440
He's at the Village Chief's residence.

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:44.600
Better hurry over.

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:48.960
It'll be a lucrative deal.

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:52.120
This way.

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:55.400
Please.

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:00.760
Such a grand air...

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:02.240
- My lord.
- about him.

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:03.080
She's here.

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:11.240
Greetings, my lord.

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:16.360
You...

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:18.800
must be He Qingqing.

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:20.440
That's right.

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:21.960
I'm the owner of the food shop.

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:23.160
Not to boast,

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:24.440
but our dishes

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:26.400
are unique in all of Jinshui Town.

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:27.480
My lord, just name

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:28.320
whatever you want.

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:29.400
Alright.

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:32.560
Then make me a dish

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:34.120
that could

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:36.040
bring a wayward child back home

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:37.680
and change his mind.

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:44.320
Sanniang,

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:45.680
where's Qingqing?

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:46.760
A big figure invited her

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:47.880
to the Village Chief's home.

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:50.520
What important guest?

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:52.440
I didn't get to see them,

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:53.800
but I spotted his men,

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:55.120
dressed like a military officer.

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:56.440
You...

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:03.520
As long as you can prepare this dish.

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:05.840
All these

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:08.200
will be yours.

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:12.640
My lord,

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:15.480
your offer is indeed tempting.

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:17.120
But I truly cannot make it.

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:18.240
I must ask you

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:19.600
to seek someone more skilled.

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:29.120
What do you mean?

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:32.040
Why still detain someone
who can't make it?

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:34.640
Seizing a young lady in broad daylight?

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:36.040
Let me out.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:37.840
Let me out.

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:43.480
Why are you here?

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:44.400
He...

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:01.400
I, a commoner,

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:03.560
pay respect to General Su.

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:06.320
A commoner?

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:11.840
You've completely lost your senses.

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:13.480
You unfilial child!

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:15.200
Kneel!

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:25.680
Hey, you.

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:27.480
Why raise your hand to strike?

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:29.920
I'm disciplining my own son.

00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:32.040
It's not your place
as an outsider to interfere.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:33.840
Father.

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:38.120
Father?

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:41.480
If today,

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:43.120
it weren't for this woman being here,

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:45.480
you probably wouldn't have
come to see me

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:48.280
nor would you call me "Father".

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:52.560
Qingqing is innocent.

00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:57.280
I beg you to spare her.

00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:03.760
Let her go?

00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:11.120
Very well.

00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:14.200
As long as you're willing

00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:15.920
to return and inherit the ancestral estate,

00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:17.880
as your father,

00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:19.560
I am willing to forgive you.

00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:22.000
Naturally, I will not trouble this lady.

00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:27.200
Can I say something?

00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:35.600
If you truly wish to go,

00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:37.440
I won't stand in your way.

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:40.440
But if you just fear of burdening me,

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:43.600
then please don't compromise.

00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:46.880
Do you still remember

00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:49.160
what you once told me?

00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:51.720
You need not be bound by others' rules.

00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:55.000
"Simply follow the call of your own heart."

00:05:56.880 --> 00:05:58.120
You headstrong woman,

00:05:58.320 --> 00:06:00.000
even now you dare to

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:01.280
sway my son's mind.

00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:03.600
Do you wish him to stray further?

00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:04.840
He has his own dreams.

00:06:04.840 --> 00:06:05.760
His way of life

00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:07.000
simply didn't follow

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:08.000
the path you set for him.

00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:09.160
How is that wrong?

00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:10.680
But you...

00:06:10.920 --> 00:06:12.440
using someone's weakness as leverage

00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:14.600
is hardly the act of a true gentleman.

00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:15.440
You...

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:22.840
Yanjin,

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:25.440
I ask you as your father,

00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:29.320
are you willing to return with me?

00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:46.320
I am not willing.

00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:49.680
If you force me to go back,

00:06:51.160 --> 00:06:52.440
I've escaped once

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:54.880
and I'll surely escape again.

00:06:58.560 --> 00:06:59.400
Guards.

00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:01.000
Lock him up for me.

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:02.000
Lock him up

00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:03.880
until he comes to his senses!

00:07:03.880 --> 00:07:04.720
No need.

00:07:09.920 --> 00:07:10.880
I'll walk on my own.

00:07:30.120 --> 00:07:31.040
As for you,

00:07:32.680 --> 00:07:34.440
when you manage to make a dish

00:07:35.160 --> 00:07:37.560
that will make him change his mind,

00:07:38.600 --> 00:07:39.480
I will

00:07:40.320 --> 00:07:42.280
let you go.

00:07:54.840 --> 00:07:57.680
That village woman's defiant manner

00:07:59.320 --> 00:08:01.600
looks surprisingly similar to yours.

00:08:02.840 --> 00:08:05.280
No wonder you were swayed by her.

00:08:10.120 --> 00:08:11.200
She never tried to sway me.

00:08:13.560 --> 00:08:14.920
I was willing from the start.

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:22.560
As your father, I thought

00:08:23.600 --> 00:08:25.000
you turned your back

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:26.760
on generational martial heritage

00:08:27.760 --> 00:08:29.680
only for what you called

00:08:29.680 --> 00:08:31.120
aspiration to join officialdom.

00:08:33.440 --> 00:08:35.120
But I'd never expect you

00:08:36.120 --> 00:08:37.680
to discard all that

00:08:37.680 --> 00:08:39.480
for the sake of

00:08:39.600 --> 00:08:41.040
a village widow.

00:08:42.440 --> 00:08:44.880
Yet you still say she didn't sway you.

00:08:50.440 --> 00:08:51.440
She is not terrible.

00:08:54.560 --> 00:08:55.400
On the contrary,

00:08:57.150 --> 00:08:58.540
she is the brightest soul

00:08:58.550 --> 00:09:00.060
I've ever met in this world.

00:09:03.920 --> 00:09:04.760
With her by my side,

00:09:06.320 --> 00:09:07.290
I finally understood

00:09:07.300 --> 00:09:08.640
what a true family means,

00:09:10.480 --> 00:09:12.200
what true kinship feels like,

00:09:12.440 --> 00:09:13.280
what love is,

00:09:15.320 --> 00:09:16.160
and...

00:09:16.680 --> 00:09:18.560
what kind of life I truly want.

00:09:21.600 --> 00:09:23.320
Utterly foolish.

00:09:25.880 --> 00:09:27.320
I'll make you see,

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:28.840
she

00:09:29.600 --> 00:09:32.120
is not worth your devotion.

00:09:54.560 --> 00:09:56.200
A rustic thing from the countryside

00:09:56.960 --> 00:09:58.880
never fits for the grand hall.

00:10:01.080 --> 00:10:01.960
Which dish

00:10:02.200 --> 00:10:04.080
is what I asked for?

00:10:05.760 --> 00:10:06.760
Please, have patience.

00:10:07.080 --> 00:10:08.680
Let me explain it slowly.

00:10:09.560 --> 00:10:10.420
This dish

00:10:10.440 --> 00:10:12.200
is called Spring Breeze and Gentle Rain.

00:10:12.680 --> 00:10:14.120
I use tender, silky fish fillet,

00:10:14.120 --> 00:10:15.560
and bamboo shoots of the season.

00:10:15.960 --> 00:10:17.200
Once you've finished it,

00:10:17.320 --> 00:10:18.960
your heart will feel at ease

00:10:19.240 --> 00:10:20.800
and you'll be open-minded.

00:10:22.240 --> 00:10:25.800
This one is named Stubbornness Stew.

00:10:26.080 --> 00:10:28.200
It's made with beef tendon and pork bones.

00:10:28.200 --> 00:10:29.520
Slow-simmered over a gentle flame.

00:10:29.680 --> 00:10:30.760
But when you eat it,

00:10:30.760 --> 00:10:32.000
be sure to take small bites.

00:10:32.200 --> 00:10:33.560
The texture is too tough

00:10:33.560 --> 00:10:34.440
to digest easily.

00:10:34.560 --> 00:10:35.880
If you happen to choke on it,

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:37.640
it could be life-threatening.

00:10:41.440 --> 00:10:42.440
General Su, if you

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:44.880
find neither of these dishes appealing,

00:10:45.120 --> 00:10:46.760
then I would strongly recommend

00:10:46.880 --> 00:10:48.880
the Solitary Soup.

00:10:49.240 --> 00:10:50.760
Made with the old bad-tempered roosters

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:52.320
who also loves to peck at people.

00:10:52.520 --> 00:10:53.800
Stewed for three full hours...

00:10:53.800 --> 00:10:54.640
Scoundrel!

00:10:55.440 --> 00:10:57.000
You've got some nerve.

00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:58.080
Daring to mock me?

00:11:01.640 --> 00:11:03.080
(Next Episode)
Grandpa,

00:11:03.320 --> 00:11:04.920
please!

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:07.600
Let Daddy eat.

00:11:07.600 --> 00:11:09.040
If you keep swinging that sword carelessly,

00:11:09.960 --> 00:11:11.220
you'll hurt yourself.

00:11:12.640 --> 00:11:14.040
Grandpa's amazing!

00:11:14.440 --> 00:11:16.440
If you can gather one thousand taels

00:11:17.040 --> 00:11:18.600
within a single day

00:11:18.600 --> 00:11:20.480
to support the army,

00:11:21.160 --> 00:11:22.080
I might

00:11:22.440 --> 00:11:25.000
consider reuniting your family.

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:26.640
General, there's only nine hundred taels.

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:28.280
I'll find the remaining hundred

00:11:28.400 --> 00:11:29.520
as soon as possible.

00:11:29.720 --> 00:11:32.040
There's no room for negotiation.

00:11:34.120 --> 00:11:36.400
You'd better stop dreaming.
