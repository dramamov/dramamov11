Councilor Kang

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:50.520
will announce the winner

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:52.480
of this year's Competition.

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:57.240
Congratulations

(Jinxiu Tavern Shen's Diner)
to Hermit Suxin

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:00.450
(Guixiang Tavern Yunlai Tavern)
for

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:03.260
(Yuelai Tavern Laywoman Suxin)
becoming the Winner.

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:04.770
(Ruifu Tavern)
You are well-deserved.

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:06.190
Universally acknowledged.

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:13.040
Bravo!

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:27.710
- Grandpa.
- Yangyang.

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:28.990
Grandpa.

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:30.120
Gently, gently.

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:30.990
Sorry, Grandpa.

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:32.800
It's OK.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.440
I knew it wouldn't be so easy
to become the Culinary Master.

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:36.700
But Grandpa,

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:38.310
you are the Culinary Master in my heart.

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:39.660
The Culinary Master in our hearts.

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:40.920
Really?

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:42.440
I am the Culinary Master in your heart?

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:43.310
Yeah.

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:44.850
It's the same in Grandma's heart, right?

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:47.920
Yes, you're the smartest one.

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:54.550
Let's quickly tidy up

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:55.710
and go to the clinic.

00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:57.240
We don't have to.

00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:58.960
I mean it. It will still cost money.

00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:00.200
I'm fine.

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:01.040
We have to go.

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:02.320
Listen to me.

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:03.710
OK.

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:05.040
Listen to you.

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:13.270
(Culinary Master Competition)
Prince Zhao

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:15.590
insisted on appointing that Li Ang
as the heir apparent.

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:17.530
My brother also asked me
to return to the palace,

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:20.580
causing me to miss the chance
to watch the Competition.

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:28.030
Stop right there.

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:35.640
Didn't you come here

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:37.120
to watch the Competition?

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:38.150
Why

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:39.680
did you hide whenever you see me?

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:41.990
If you want to avoid me, that's fine.

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:44.400
You don't need to run.

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:46.710
I order you

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:48.430
to get lost.

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:51.800
Useless!

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:53.400
I don't even know

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:55.520
what I saw in you.

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:56.990
I have never had anything

00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:00.500
worthy of your attention.

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:03.030
Now you finally understand

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:05.360
and have completely lost regard for me.

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:09.150
Pretty good.

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:34.840
You two couples

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:37.840
are really quite a perfect match.

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:43.640
Grandfather,

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:44.990
eat more food.

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:46.590
Alright.

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:49.070
(My grandfather wants to match me
with Mr. Lin,)

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:51.090
(and still insists on keeping us
for a meal.)

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:53.510
(What a pain!)

00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:56.720
(Shen Shaoguang, why did you walk
so slowly?)

00:04:57.160 --> 00:04:58.360
(What a sin!)

00:04:59.040 --> 00:04:59.920
(This calamity)

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:02.120
(is destined to occur in my life.)

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:04.120
(Why aren't they saying anything?)

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:06.660
(Lin Anran, how did you manage
in the official circles?)

00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:08.280
(Show off your eloquence.)

00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:11.270
Lady Shen,

00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:13.920
how is your father's hand?

00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:15.750
It's fine, he has already seen a doctor.

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:17.640
That's good.

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:19.440
Feng,

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:21.480
you care about Lady Shen like this,

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:23.750
yet you don't let your grandfather

00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:25.550
go propose marriage as soon as possible.

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:29.750
(Quick, slap me in my face.)

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:34.990
(How on earth did this man
become the chancellor?)

00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:37.310
(The world really)

00:05:37.310 --> 00:05:38.600
(is a huge makeshift troupe.)

00:05:40.190 --> 00:05:41.240
(Oh, my grandfather...)

00:06:08.510 --> 00:06:09.350
You all...

00:06:10.920 --> 00:06:12.070
Father.

00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:13.440
Yangyang.

00:06:14.310 --> 00:06:15.150
Yangyang.

00:06:15.480 --> 00:06:17.160
I miss you so much.

00:06:18.040 --> 00:06:18.880
Yangyang.

00:06:19.630 --> 00:06:20.870
It hurts.

00:06:21.700 --> 00:06:22.630
If you don't come back,

00:06:22.630 --> 00:06:24.040
I just won't want you anymore.

00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:24.950
Yangyang,

00:06:24.950 --> 00:06:25.800
I was wrong.

00:06:26.190 --> 00:06:27.030
I was wrong.

00:06:27.430 --> 00:06:28.270
I was wrong.

00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:31.960
Don't cry anymore.

00:06:33.630 --> 00:06:34.550
I won't leave.

00:06:39.750 --> 00:06:40.590
Mother.

00:06:42.040 --> 00:06:42.880
Father.

00:06:43.120 --> 00:06:43.960
Shaojie,

00:06:44.510 --> 00:06:46.070
how did you end up looking like this?

00:06:46.950 --> 00:06:48.870
- I...
- You finally come back.

00:06:49.070 --> 00:06:50.310
Do you know these past days

00:06:50.310 --> 00:06:52.120
how your mother and I have been living?

00:06:53.190 --> 00:06:54.990
- Father...
- You little brat, I...

00:06:57.300 --> 00:06:58.770
- Alright, alright
- You little brat.

00:06:59.280 --> 00:07:00.280
Father, your hand...

00:07:00.280 --> 00:07:01.310
Shaojie just comes back.

00:07:01.310 --> 00:07:02.190
Your hand...

00:07:02.360 --> 00:07:03.550
I am back anyway.

00:07:03.550 --> 00:07:04.680
Be careful with that.

00:07:04.680 --> 00:07:06.280
Jicai, thank you, Jicai.

00:07:06.480 --> 00:07:07.510
Look at our father.

00:07:07.800 --> 00:07:09.500
Do you know how worried
I was about you?

00:07:09.500 --> 00:07:10.990
Do you know how worried our father is?

00:07:10.990 --> 00:07:12.490
Do you know how worried our mother is?

00:07:12.490 --> 00:07:14.240
Do you know how worried I am about you?

00:07:14.240 --> 00:07:15.550
I'm back. I'm back.

00:07:15.920 --> 00:07:16.760
I'm back.

00:07:17.950 --> 00:07:18.790
Alright, alright.

00:07:19.120 --> 00:07:20.750
Alright, it's OK now.

00:07:20.750 --> 00:07:21.590
I'm back.

00:07:22.300 --> 00:07:23.250
I'm not leaving anymore.

00:07:24.680 --> 00:07:25.520
Who is it?

00:07:26.140 --> 00:07:26.990
Who is it?

00:07:26.990 --> 00:07:28.470
It's so late. Who is it?

00:07:28.600 --> 00:07:30.190
- Go take a look.
- I'll go take a look.

00:07:36.840 --> 00:07:37.680
Mr. Lin.

00:07:37.680 --> 00:07:38.520
Auntie Li.

00:07:39.070 --> 00:07:39.910
It's Mr. Lin.

00:07:40.430 --> 00:07:41.270
It's fine.

00:07:41.900 --> 00:07:42.870
- Mr. Lin.
- Uncle Shen.

00:07:42.870 --> 00:07:44.600
Mr. Lin.

00:07:45.280 --> 00:07:46.480
It's really you.

00:07:48.390 --> 00:07:49.800
Did Lu Yun send you here?

00:07:50.600 --> 00:07:52.360
Am I that obvious?

00:07:52.360 --> 00:07:53.310
Even you noticed it.

00:07:54.070 --> 00:07:55.720
What exactly has happened to you lately?

00:07:56.040 --> 00:07:57.480
You even got involved with Lu Yun.

00:07:57.480 --> 00:07:58.680
Hurry up and make it clear.

00:07:59.720 --> 00:08:00.560
I...

00:08:03.360 --> 00:08:04.510
(Shen's Diner)
That day,

00:08:04.550 --> 00:08:05.720
I left home,

00:08:06.360 --> 00:08:08.040
wanting to reach the pinnacle of life

00:08:08.390 --> 00:08:10.280
to prove my own strength.

00:08:10.280 --> 00:08:11.120
Thus

00:08:11.140 --> 00:08:13.160
I arrived in a strange city,

00:08:13.160 --> 00:08:14.040
Fenglin Town.

00:08:14.040 --> 00:08:14.920
There

00:08:14.920 --> 00:08:17.150
I encountered the first challenge
of my life.

00:08:38.730 --> 00:08:39.610
So...

00:08:39.630 --> 00:08:41.150
Although my journey
had been smooth,

00:08:41.150 --> 00:08:41.990
overcoming obstacles,

00:08:42.300 --> 00:08:43.800
fate was unfortunately not on my side,

00:08:43.890 --> 00:08:45.500
and I have not yet

00:08:45.500 --> 00:08:46.810
reached the pinnacle of life.

00:08:47.080 --> 00:08:48.890
I can only hide away
in the Yunlai Tavern,

00:08:49.480 --> 00:08:51.030
biding my time and enduring hardships.

00:08:51.250 --> 00:08:52.200
What a pity...

00:08:52.420 --> 00:08:53.870
I see you are getting carried away.

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:55.490
Just now, that whole rambling you said

00:08:55.500 --> 00:08:56.380
was obviously nonsense

00:08:56.380 --> 00:08:57.460
and sounds like a lie.

00:08:57.700 --> 00:08:58.920
Do you think I don't know you,

00:08:58.920 --> 00:08:59.660
Shen Gongcai?

00:09:00.220 --> 00:09:01.300
Hurry up and tell the truth.

00:09:01.300 --> 00:09:03.500
What I said is the truth.

00:09:03.500 --> 00:09:04.380
I count to three.

00:09:04.380 --> 00:09:06.190
No matter how,
what I said is still the truth.

00:09:06.200 --> 00:09:06.900
One.

00:09:07.860 --> 00:09:09.220
- Two.
- Wait.

00:09:09.850 --> 00:09:10.720
I was wrong.

00:09:12.060 --> 00:09:13.780
I never made a name for myself at all.

00:09:14.540 --> 00:09:15.650
After unemployment,

00:09:16.020 --> 00:09:17.580
I just kept wandering the streets.

00:09:17.900 --> 00:09:19.770
I really don't have the face
to come back.

00:09:20.650 --> 00:09:21.980
So I took an alias

00:09:21.980 --> 00:09:23.660
and went to work at the Yunlai Tavern.

00:09:23.750 --> 00:09:25.100
They didn't recognize me at all.

00:09:25.120 --> 00:09:26.140
Nor do I know why they

00:09:26.140 --> 00:09:27.060
just, just chose me

00:09:27.060 --> 00:09:28.860
and let me stir up trouble
for our family,

00:09:28.860 --> 00:09:30.500
but I didn't intend to do anything

00:09:30.500 --> 00:09:31.800
and there's no way I could do it.

00:09:31.980 --> 00:09:32.820
I didn't expect,

00:09:33.500 --> 00:09:35.100
because of me

00:09:35.100 --> 00:09:36.330
that father's hand got injured.

00:09:36.330 --> 00:09:37.550
So those letters that you wrote

00:09:37.550 --> 00:09:39.020
were all fake?

00:09:39.020 --> 00:09:39.900
How did you

00:09:39.900 --> 00:09:41.300
end up in the enemy army?

00:09:41.980 --> 00:09:43.740
You might as well go beg for food.

00:09:43.740 --> 00:09:45.340
I did, but didn't get any.

00:09:45.400 --> 00:09:46.800
- Father.
- Father, Father, Father.

00:09:46.800 --> 00:09:47.620
Be careful.

00:09:47.780 --> 00:09:49.420
Don't hurt your hand again.

00:09:51.580 --> 00:09:52.620
These past days,

00:09:52.620 --> 00:09:54.900
have you noticed anything unusual
in Yunlai?

00:09:54.900 --> 00:09:55.740
Unusual?

00:09:56.740 --> 00:09:58.020
That place is a den of evil.

00:09:58.220 --> 00:09:59.100
Only one meal a day.

00:09:59.100 --> 00:10:00.760
All the dirty and exhausting work
is mine.

00:10:00.760 --> 00:10:01.690
Everything is abnormal.

00:10:01.690 --> 00:10:02.700
Nothing is normal.

00:10:03.100 --> 00:10:04.180
I'm not talking about this.

00:10:04.740 --> 00:10:07.180
Lu Yun opening a tavern
might just be a cover.

00:10:07.400 --> 00:10:10.280
In fact, he's helping Prince Zhao
accumulate wealth and transport goods.

00:10:10.500 --> 00:10:11.460
Did you notice anything?

00:10:12.100 --> 00:10:13.780
If you put it that way...

00:10:26.780 --> 00:10:27.620
Come here.

00:10:28.340 --> 00:10:29.900
There is indeed a large amount of goods

00:10:29.900 --> 00:10:31.380
going in and out every day
at Lu Yun's place.

00:10:31.380 --> 00:10:32.660
So many that it's abnormal.

00:10:32.660 --> 00:10:33.880
And in every batch of boxes,

00:10:33.880 --> 00:10:34.820
there are always a few

00:10:34.820 --> 00:10:35.940
that are nailed very firmly.

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:37.420
They are definitely not ingredients.

00:10:37.420 --> 00:10:39.140
Otherwise, they've all gotten stuffy.

00:10:39.700 --> 00:10:40.540
What's more,

00:10:40.900 --> 00:10:42.500
on the boxes, there's also something

00:10:42.500 --> 00:10:44.340
like a totem.

00:10:44.700 --> 00:10:45.590
Let me draw it for you.

00:10:54.340 --> 00:10:55.180
Look.

00:10:55.180 --> 00:10:56.180
It's roughly like this.

00:11:09.470 --> 00:11:10.540
Is that so?

00:11:10.540 --> 00:11:11.740
Yes, that's it.

00:11:11.740 --> 00:11:12.580
Exactly the same.

00:11:16.740 --> 00:11:18.020
It's my duty

00:11:18.670 --> 00:11:20.220
to ensure the safety of Juxian Alley.

00:11:20.300 --> 00:11:21.670
Could their hideout in Juxian Alley

00:11:21.680 --> 00:11:23.480
be related to you reversing the case?

00:11:24.200 --> 00:11:25.500
The hideout you mentioned earlier

00:11:25.500 --> 00:11:27.180
you mentioned earlier

00:11:27.390 --> 00:11:28.740
is the Yunlai Tavern.

00:11:31.140 --> 00:11:32.780
You also mentioned Prince Zhao.

00:11:32.780 --> 00:11:33.960
It seems that this Prince Zhao

00:11:33.960 --> 00:11:35.900
is related to the case of your family.

00:11:36.460 --> 00:11:37.420
Could it be

00:11:37.420 --> 00:11:38.940
that Prince Zhao did it?

00:11:40.940 --> 00:11:41.780
Mr. Lin,

00:11:41.940 --> 00:11:42.820
are you going

00:11:43.140 --> 00:11:44.780
to investigate Yunlai Tavern next?

00:11:46.580 --> 00:11:48.580
With me as an undercover agent
already in place,

00:11:48.580 --> 00:11:50.260
wouldn't that be very convenient?

00:11:50.420 --> 00:11:51.260
Great.

00:11:51.540 --> 00:11:53.000
I never expected

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:54.660
that after muddling
through half my life,

00:11:54.700 --> 00:11:57.060
I, Shen Shaojie,
would still have the chance

00:11:57.060 --> 00:11:58.890
to punish the wicked,
giving back to society.

00:11:58.890 --> 00:12:00.020
Well, this is a good thing.

00:12:00.020 --> 00:12:00.860
Right?

00:12:01.560 --> 00:12:02.500
Mr. Lin,

00:12:02.500 --> 00:12:04.740
if I truly help your family
clear your injustice,

00:12:05.740 --> 00:12:06.690
wouldn't the descendants

00:12:06.690 --> 00:12:07.870
also remember my name?

00:12:11.180 --> 00:12:12.420
Handsome Shen.

00:12:13.440 --> 00:12:15.020
My father is just too cool!

00:12:15.180 --> 00:12:17.620
Shaojie, please assist me
in entering Yunlai tomorrow.

00:12:17.940 --> 00:12:19.180
I need to find out exactly

00:12:19.180 --> 00:12:20.780
what is in those boxes.

00:12:21.580 --> 00:12:22.580
Once it's done,

00:12:22.580 --> 00:12:24.300
you'll completely cut ties with Yunlai.

00:12:26.380 --> 00:12:27.260
That's all?

00:12:27.330 --> 00:12:28.180
That's all.

00:12:28.180 --> 00:12:29.380
You don't have any other tasks

00:12:29.380 --> 00:12:30.340
for me to do?

00:12:31.900 --> 00:12:32.780
Shaojie,

00:12:33.100 --> 00:12:34.820
this matter should not be taken lightly.

00:12:45.100 --> 00:12:46.840
These are all today's specials
at our place.

00:12:46.840 --> 00:12:48.500
(Yunlai Tavern)
Ladies.

00:12:51.630 --> 00:12:53.100
So many bowls.

00:12:53.340 --> 00:12:54.580
And leave me to wash them alone.

00:12:55.220 --> 00:12:56.110
Just wait.

00:12:57.340 --> 00:12:58.940
Tonight I, Shen Shaojie,

00:12:59.100 --> 00:13:00.580
is about to join the ancestor

00:13:01.730 --> 00:13:03.260
to eliminate harm for the people.

00:13:04.660 --> 00:13:06.140
Come on, brothers.

00:13:06.500 --> 00:13:07.340
Alright, alright.

00:13:08.340 --> 00:13:09.580
Bring that over here.

00:13:09.740 --> 00:13:10.660
OK.

00:13:10.660 --> 00:13:11.740
What are they doing?

00:13:22.060 --> 00:13:22.900
Here.

00:13:23.100 --> 00:13:23.940
Give it to me.

00:13:24.260 --> 00:13:25.100
Tie it tight.

00:13:25.380 --> 00:13:26.220
OK.

00:13:32.180 --> 00:13:33.020
Another bag.

00:13:37.620 --> 00:13:38.940
Washing dishes is really tiring.

00:13:39.180 --> 00:13:40.300
Come out and get some sun.

00:13:45.140 --> 00:13:46.340
Bro. Bro. Bro.

00:13:46.740 --> 00:13:47.580
Moving, right?

00:13:47.580 --> 00:13:48.500
Yeah, moving.

00:13:48.500 --> 00:13:50.140
Leave this physical work to me.

00:13:50.140 --> 00:13:51.300
I'm full of strength.

00:13:51.300 --> 00:13:52.380
- Can you do it?
- Come on.

00:13:52.380 --> 00:13:53.020
Leave it to me.

00:13:53.220 --> 00:13:54.060
It's a piece of cake.

00:13:55.780 --> 00:13:56.620
So heavy!

00:14:04.260 --> 00:14:05.340
Shen Shaojie.

00:14:07.060 --> 00:14:07.900
Come on.

00:14:08.540 --> 00:14:09.380
Take care.

00:14:09.980 --> 00:14:10.820
Who is it?

00:14:10.820 --> 00:14:11.900
Who is called Shen Shaojie?

00:14:11.900 --> 00:14:13.100
At least respond with a yes.

00:14:13.160 --> 00:14:14.140
That's way too impolite.

00:14:14.140 --> 00:14:14.980
Well.

00:14:16.180 --> 00:14:17.020
Don't you know?

00:14:17.160 --> 00:14:18.550
You've already given yourself away.

00:14:19.340 --> 00:14:20.700
No, no, no.

00:14:20.700 --> 00:14:21.540
It's real.

00:14:21.880 --> 00:14:22.740
It's real.

00:14:22.740 --> 00:14:23.620
This is more real.

00:14:23.620 --> 00:14:24.540
Don't pull it.

00:14:24.540 --> 00:14:25.500
It hurts.

00:14:36.500 --> 00:14:37.860
(Yunlai)

00:15:35.540 --> 00:15:36.940
Mr. Lin, you have impressive skills.

00:15:40.380 --> 00:15:41.900
Mr. Lu, you set a trap for me.

00:15:42.520 --> 00:15:44.060
You're always well-prepared, aren't you?

00:15:46.700 --> 00:15:47.620
Where is Shen Shaojie?

00:15:52.420 --> 00:15:53.300
No, no, no.

00:15:54.060 --> 00:15:54.940
Be careful.

00:15:54.940 --> 00:15:56.300
Be sure to pay attention!

00:15:56.540 --> 00:15:57.620
Be careful, be careful!

00:15:57.720 --> 00:15:58.560
Well,

00:15:59.660 --> 00:16:00.860
let's talk it over calmly.

00:16:01.100 --> 00:16:02.560
If we end up with mutual destruction,

00:16:02.560 --> 00:16:03.940
that's really not worth it, right?

00:16:03.940 --> 00:16:04.780
Scared?

00:16:05.970 --> 00:16:07.500
Then let Mr. Lin put down the sword.

00:16:08.020 --> 00:16:08.870
Speak properly.

00:16:09.110 --> 00:16:10.020
No, no, no.

00:16:10.020 --> 00:16:10.940
Put down your sword.

00:16:10.940 --> 00:16:13.020
Bro, you should put the knife down too,
right?

00:16:13.020 --> 00:16:13.990
Let's talk it out calmly.

00:16:13.990 --> 00:16:14.980
This looks really bad.

00:16:14.990 --> 00:16:16.500
Everyone, calm down.

00:16:16.780 --> 00:16:17.620
Let him go.

00:16:18.090 --> 00:16:18.980
I will take his place.

00:16:19.220 --> 00:16:20.180
Yes, yes.

00:16:20.180 --> 00:16:21.020
Let me go first.

00:16:21.100 --> 00:16:22.880
Whether you want him
can be discussed later.

00:16:22.880 --> 00:16:23.780
Keeping me is useless.

00:16:23.780 --> 00:16:24.860
It's completely useless.

00:16:25.100 --> 00:16:26.140
Bro, bro,

00:16:26.140 --> 00:16:28.060
please, move the knife away a bit.

00:16:28.060 --> 00:16:29.100
Mr. Lin's life

00:16:29.500 --> 00:16:31.580
is naturally more valuable
than Shen Shaojie's.

00:16:32.340 --> 00:16:33.180
OK.

00:16:33.900 --> 00:16:34.990
You abandon the sword

00:16:35.340 --> 00:16:36.580
and walk over here yourself.

00:16:36.730 --> 00:16:37.760
Have to abandon the sword?

00:16:51.500 --> 00:16:52.940
Bro, be careful.

00:16:52.940 --> 00:16:54.260
Blades have no eyes.

00:16:54.660 --> 00:16:55.500
Be careful.

00:16:55.620 --> 00:16:56.460
Be careful.

00:17:13.780 --> 00:17:14.620
Great!

00:17:16.620 --> 00:17:18.140
Mr. Lin, speak nicely.

00:17:19.080 --> 00:17:19.980
D-d-don't move.

00:17:19.980 --> 00:17:20.820
Don't move.

00:17:21.900 --> 00:17:23.220
Back off, back off, back off.

00:17:23.220 --> 00:17:24.520
Quick, back off, don't come over.

00:17:24.520 --> 00:17:25.260
Step back.

00:17:27.860 --> 00:17:28.700
Don't move.

00:17:29.300 --> 00:17:30.660
Now you're scared too.

00:17:30.660 --> 00:17:31.500
Scared, huh?

00:17:36.260 --> 00:17:37.100
Mr. Lin,

00:17:37.420 --> 00:17:38.500
let's talk this out calmly.

00:17:48.380 --> 00:17:49.940
Young Master, here.

00:17:49.940 --> 00:17:50.780
Quick.

00:17:52.060 --> 00:17:52.900
It's OK now.

00:17:55.660 --> 00:17:57.140
- Quick.
- Still running?

00:17:58.820 --> 00:17:59.660
Mr. Lin.

00:18:00.700 --> 00:18:02.580
Mr. Lin.

00:18:02.580 --> 00:18:03.420
There's no one.

00:18:03.580 --> 00:18:04.420
There's no one.

00:18:04.820 --> 00:18:05.660
In my opinion,

00:18:06.120 --> 00:18:07.360
we should have shaken them off.

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:09.600
There are Jinwu Guards everywhere here.

00:18:09.920 --> 00:18:11.560
Lu Yun wouldn't dare
to chase us anymore.

00:18:11.700 --> 00:18:12.540
Mr. Lin,

00:18:12.740 --> 00:18:13.740
they transferred

00:18:13.740 --> 00:18:14.820
all the goods from the box

00:18:14.820 --> 00:18:15.940
with the totem printed on it.

00:18:17.340 --> 00:18:18.420
But maybe

00:18:18.660 --> 00:18:19.980
I can help you find those things.

00:18:20.140 --> 00:18:21.520
It's just that we need to be quick.

00:18:21.620 --> 00:18:22.970
Because the duration of that scent

00:18:22.980 --> 00:18:23.710
is limited.

00:18:23.740 --> 00:18:24.580
Scent?

00:18:25.260 --> 00:18:26.100
Yes.

00:18:26.790 --> 00:18:28.940
I saw them suddenly start moving things.

00:18:29.380 --> 00:18:30.620
I was worried these bad people

00:18:30.620 --> 00:18:32.080
would move these pieces of evidence,

00:18:32.340 --> 00:18:33.860
so I stole some strong-smelling spices

00:18:33.860 --> 00:18:35.940
from the kitchen

00:18:35.940 --> 00:18:37.180
and made them into sachets.

00:18:37.580 --> 00:18:38.520
Then I put some lime

00:18:38.520 --> 00:18:40.220
inside the sachets

00:18:40.520 --> 00:18:41.540
and soaked them in water.

00:18:41.600 --> 00:18:43.350
Isn't this basically
a self-heating hotpot?

00:18:43.660 --> 00:18:44.500
Moving, huh?

00:18:44.600 --> 00:18:45.460
Yeah, moving.

00:18:45.460 --> 00:18:46.940
Leave this physical work to me.

00:18:47.060 --> 00:18:48.340
I'm full of strength.

00:18:48.640 --> 00:18:50.220
- Can you do it?
- Come on.

00:18:50.220 --> 00:18:51.760
Leave it to me. This is a little case.

00:18:58.220 --> 00:18:59.180
Self-heating pot?

00:19:00.060 --> 00:19:01.260
What I mean is,

00:19:01.940 --> 00:19:03.060
lime gives off heat

00:19:03.300 --> 00:19:04.320
when mixed with water,

00:19:04.320 --> 00:19:06.200
which is essentially
like cooking those spices.

00:19:06.260 --> 00:19:07.240
Then we follow the scent,

00:19:07.240 --> 00:19:08.980
just like recognizing a horse
by its smell.

00:19:08.980 --> 00:19:10.880
Then it might be possible
to find those things.

00:19:11.980 --> 00:19:13.840
There are 108 alleys in Yong'an City.

00:19:13.850 --> 00:19:16.080
Only a few places are suitable
for building warehouses.

00:19:16.100 --> 00:19:17.280
No one lights a fire at night.

00:19:17.290 --> 00:19:18.490
Spices from the Western Regions

00:19:18.490 --> 00:19:19.620
become pungent after cooking.

00:19:19.650 --> 00:19:20.890
It's easy to tell the direction.

00:19:20.890 --> 00:19:21.660
Yeah.

00:19:22.740 --> 00:19:23.660
Shen,

00:19:23.660 --> 00:19:25.030
you're truly wise appearing simple.

00:19:25.560 --> 00:19:26.420
Well...

00:19:26.420 --> 00:19:27.460
I'll go find it right away.

00:19:27.460 --> 00:19:28.350
Liu Chang,

00:19:28.350 --> 00:19:29.370
you escort Shen back.

00:19:29.400 --> 00:19:30.720
- Watch out for the guards.
- Got it.

00:19:30.860 --> 00:19:31.940
Mr. Lin praised me

00:19:32.260 --> 00:19:33.700
as being wise yet appearing simple.

00:19:33.700 --> 00:19:35.060
It's kind of embarrassing.

00:19:39.220 --> 00:19:40.060
Being wise...

00:19:40.820 --> 00:19:41.660
Wise.

00:19:41.860 --> 00:19:42.700
Yet appearing simple.

00:19:43.220 --> 00:19:44.620
Mr. Shen, hurry up and leave.

00:19:46.420 --> 00:19:48.020
Do I... do I look very foolish?

00:19:53.620 --> 00:19:54.460
What's that smell?

00:19:54.600 --> 00:19:55.620
Why does it smell so good?

00:19:56.660 --> 00:19:57.580
It's already nighttime.

00:19:57.580 --> 00:19:58.420
Who's cooking?

00:19:58.580 --> 00:20:00.100
Yeah, this job is making me

00:20:00.100 --> 00:20:01.140
almost starve.

00:20:01.140 --> 00:20:02.540
- Get something to eat.
- Let's go.

00:20:02.540 --> 00:20:03.380
Eat some.

00:21:05.620 --> 00:21:06.460
I'm telling you,

00:21:06.980 --> 00:21:08.700
I simply didn't find the field

00:21:08.700 --> 00:21:09.820
I was good at before.

00:21:10.340 --> 00:21:11.120
In fact,

00:21:11.120 --> 00:21:13.220
I am very likely a naturally gifted
undercover agent

00:21:13.220 --> 00:21:14.380
who can act

00:21:14.580 --> 00:21:16.900
on behalf of justice and punish evil.

00:21:17.180 --> 00:21:18.020
Applause.

00:21:19.180 --> 00:21:20.020
Father,

00:21:20.170 --> 00:21:22.060
are you really telling the truth?

00:21:22.240 --> 00:21:23.260
Of course what I'm saying

00:21:23.260 --> 00:21:24.380
is really true.

00:21:24.380 --> 00:21:25.860
When have I ever lied to you?

00:21:27.460 --> 00:21:28.780
- Mr. Lin.
- Young Master.

00:21:28.780 --> 00:21:29.840
- Mr. Lin.
- Mr. Lin.

00:21:29.840 --> 00:21:31.550
- Mr. Lin, you're back.
- Are you alright?

00:21:31.550 --> 00:21:32.940
- Mr. Lin, are you OK?
- I'm fine.

00:21:32.980 --> 00:21:34.420
Did my father really help you?

00:21:35.340 --> 00:21:36.820
This time we truly have to thank him.

00:21:37.060 --> 00:21:38.940
If he hadn't used spices
as guiding markers,

00:21:39.300 --> 00:21:40.900
I couldn't find the warehouse at all.

00:21:40.960 --> 00:21:42.190
- Really?
- Really.

00:21:43.780 --> 00:21:45.740
Shaojie, you really nailed it this time.

00:21:45.940 --> 00:21:47.340
Well done, Shen Gongcai.

00:21:47.340 --> 00:21:49.260
You've really amazing this time.

00:21:49.780 --> 00:21:51.780
Our ancestral tomb
is emitting auspicious smoke.

00:21:51.780 --> 00:21:53.440
Look, I told you from the very beginning

00:21:53.440 --> 00:21:54.940
that I achieved something remarkable,

00:21:54.940 --> 00:21:56.040
yet none of you believed me

00:21:56.040 --> 00:21:56.830
and even wronged me.

00:21:56.830 --> 00:21:57.930
This is simply unreasonable.

00:21:59.420 --> 00:22:00.860
Father, I'm sorry.

00:22:01.380 --> 00:22:03.620
We shouldn't have said that
to you just now.

00:22:04.980 --> 00:22:06.220
My father is a great hero.

00:22:06.420 --> 00:22:08.140
My father is an amazing great hero.

00:22:09.820 --> 00:22:10.660
That's right.

00:22:12.320 --> 00:22:13.740
Your father is indeed a great hero.

00:22:14.420 --> 00:22:15.580
Here comes the great hero.

00:22:15.580 --> 00:22:16.420
Here I come.

00:22:29.860 --> 00:22:31.780
You have to shave layer by layer.

00:22:31.900 --> 00:22:33.180
- You don't have to.
- Shut up.

00:22:33.180 --> 00:22:34.120
Why don't you shave it?

00:22:34.120 --> 00:22:35.340
My hand is injured.

00:22:35.940 --> 00:22:36.900
Stop arguing, Father.

00:22:36.900 --> 00:22:38.060
Listen to my mother.

00:22:38.060 --> 00:22:38.900
San.

00:22:40.180 --> 00:22:41.020
San.

00:22:41.120 --> 00:22:42.160
You go to the toilet, huh?

00:22:44.700 --> 00:22:46.260
As soon as Mr. Shen returned,

00:22:46.260 --> 00:22:47.340
none of you went to sleep.

00:22:48.060 --> 00:22:49.180
Let me introduce him to you.

00:22:49.420 --> 00:22:51.060
This is Yu San,

00:22:51.380 --> 00:22:53.460
the newly hired head chef
of our diner.

00:22:53.700 --> 00:22:54.700
He's impressive.

00:22:55.350 --> 00:22:56.780
Nice to meet you, San.

00:22:57.900 --> 00:22:58.740
San,

00:22:58.900 --> 00:23:00.100
this is our son.

00:23:00.100 --> 00:23:00.940
Shen...

00:23:03.020 --> 00:23:03.860
Go ahead.

00:23:05.260 --> 00:23:06.220
Shaojie.

00:23:08.930 --> 00:23:09.940
San,

00:23:09.940 --> 00:23:11.340
you just said,

00:23:11.340 --> 00:23:13.100
as soon as Mr. Shen returned,

00:23:13.480 --> 00:23:15.260
you know my elder brother?

00:23:18.390 --> 00:23:19.340
I'm not stupid.

00:23:20.180 --> 00:23:21.820
It's so late,
and you're in your own yard

00:23:21.820 --> 00:23:23.770
doing something as intimate
as shaving his beard,

00:23:23.800 --> 00:23:25.260
it's obvious he can't be anyone else.

00:23:25.420 --> 00:23:26.260
Right?

00:23:26.460 --> 00:23:28.340
See, he's a born chef,

00:23:28.540 --> 00:23:29.580
so smart.

00:23:29.900 --> 00:23:31.100
He spotted it right away.

00:23:33.740 --> 00:23:35.100
Alright then, you guys carry on.

00:23:35.100 --> 00:23:36.200
I'll go back and rest first.

00:23:36.300 --> 00:23:37.700
All right, you go to sleep.

00:23:38.300 --> 00:23:39.140
Take care.

00:23:40.210 --> 00:23:41.060
I'm telling you,

00:23:41.060 --> 00:23:42.340
that guy's very nice.

00:23:42.450 --> 00:23:43.580
Yeah, he looks pretty good.

00:23:46.020 --> 00:23:47.580
- What, Mother?
- Keep shaving.

00:23:54.280 --> 00:23:55.250
There's something wrong

00:23:55.260 --> 00:23:56.170
with Yu San.

00:23:57.020 --> 00:23:58.380
What's wrong?

00:23:58.380 --> 00:24:00.740
Lu Yun can catch my brother on the spot,

00:24:01.120 --> 00:24:03.750
but it's very likely that it wasn't
my brother giving himself away.

00:24:04.020 --> 00:24:05.140
My brother is dumb.

00:24:05.140 --> 00:24:07.060
Are Lu Yun's people really that smart?

00:24:07.860 --> 00:24:09.260
Watch your wording.

00:24:09.540 --> 00:24:10.570
What I mean is

00:24:10.580 --> 00:24:12.830
that it's very likely
there's a mole passing on message.

00:24:13.900 --> 00:24:14.740
Wait.

00:24:15.140 --> 00:24:16.140
I remember now.

00:24:16.140 --> 00:24:17.400
That day when we were discussing

00:24:17.400 --> 00:24:18.420
the undercover plan,

00:24:19.660 --> 00:24:21.180
could he have overheard us?

00:24:34.600 --> 00:24:36.160
Freshly cooked fish and lamb delicacy.

00:24:36.160 --> 00:24:37.480
You've been busy for half the day.

00:24:37.800 --> 00:24:38.770
Taste it while it's hot.

00:24:42.860 --> 00:24:43.700
San,

00:24:44.060 --> 00:24:45.020
you fish

00:24:45.020 --> 00:24:46.900
is only superficially refined;

00:24:47.380 --> 00:24:49.260
take a look inside,

00:24:49.780 --> 00:24:51.100
it's full of a fishy, rank stench.

00:24:54.380 --> 00:24:56.500
San, the fish you cooked...

00:24:56.980 --> 00:24:58.460
I don't even know what to say.

00:24:58.740 --> 00:25:00.100
Quick, take it away.

00:25:00.100 --> 00:25:00.940
It's too smelly.

00:25:14.280 --> 00:25:15.180
Milady.

00:25:15.180 --> 00:25:16.020
Deyuan.

00:25:16.030 --> 00:25:18.200
- Want candied hawthorn?
- The vow was spoken sincerely

00:25:18.220 --> 00:25:19.990
yet I never expected him
to change his heart.

00:25:20.020 --> 00:25:21.380
Since he has broken his vow,

00:25:21.700 --> 00:25:23.220
then let it go.

00:25:23.940 --> 00:25:25.940
Yangyang, what does this mean?

00:25:26.300 --> 00:25:27.860
The meaning of this poem is

00:25:27.860 --> 00:25:29.260
if someone betrays,

00:25:29.500 --> 00:25:31.300
we part ways immediately

00:25:31.300 --> 00:25:32.740
and cut all ties completely.

00:25:35.340 --> 00:25:36.180
Let's go.

00:25:44.780 --> 00:25:46.300
I know you love spicy food.

00:25:46.300 --> 00:25:47.900
I picked the newly grown smartweed

00:25:48.140 --> 00:25:50.260
and made this spicy smartweed dessert.

00:25:50.500 --> 00:25:51.340
Have a taste.

00:25:51.620 --> 00:25:53.180
This is a dessert.

00:25:53.180 --> 00:25:54.460
You can even make it spicy.

00:25:55.260 --> 00:25:56.540
Are you from Misty City?

00:25:58.620 --> 00:26:00.620
Yu San, you suddenly
became so enthusiastic.

00:26:00.620 --> 00:26:01.700
I'm not used to it.

00:26:05.020 --> 00:26:05.860
Milady,

00:26:06.940 --> 00:26:08.100
don't you

00:26:08.590 --> 00:26:09.620
like me anymore?

00:26:10.500 --> 00:26:12.180
How could you think that?

00:26:13.220 --> 00:26:15.520
Recently, Mr. Shen and Mrs. Shen
have always spoken to me

00:26:15.660 --> 00:26:16.940
with sarcasm and hostility.

00:26:17.220 --> 00:26:18.340
They were too tired

00:26:18.340 --> 00:26:19.700
and spoke without thinking.

00:26:20.300 --> 00:26:21.180
Well, yangyang

00:26:21.180 --> 00:26:22.420
ran away as soon as she saw me.

00:26:22.500 --> 00:26:23.990
It's because studying is too tiring?

00:26:24.660 --> 00:26:26.100
Lately, there have been many beggars.

00:26:26.100 --> 00:26:27.060
We teach her

00:26:27.060 --> 00:26:28.100
not to talk to strangers.

00:26:28.140 --> 00:26:29.540
She's probably rehearsing with you.

00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:34.400
I have been a slave for many years.

00:26:35.800 --> 00:26:37.220
Only you regard me as a human being.

00:26:37.800 --> 00:26:38.990
On the day of the Competition,

00:26:39.220 --> 00:26:40.060
you even allowed me

00:26:40.200 --> 00:26:41.480
to take time off to go and watch.

00:26:41.580 --> 00:26:42.550
Whatever you have to eat,

00:26:43.220 --> 00:26:44.980
you always save a portion for me.

00:26:45.900 --> 00:26:47.420
I'm nothing more than a slave.

00:26:47.940 --> 00:26:49.500
In this world, apart from my mother,

00:26:51.220 --> 00:26:52.980
no one will ever treat me so well again.

00:26:53.500 --> 00:26:54.740
This is actually the first time

00:26:54.740 --> 00:26:56.220
I've heard you talk about your family.

00:26:56.860 --> 00:26:57.780
I didn't know

00:26:57.940 --> 00:26:58.900
where you are from.

00:27:01.620 --> 00:27:03.210
My home is not far from Yong'an.

00:27:03.210 --> 00:27:05.080
How about going home for a visit?

00:27:05.140 --> 00:27:06.100
Take another two days...

00:27:06.100 --> 00:27:06.940
No need.

00:27:08.100 --> 00:27:09.100
There is someone at home.

00:27:09.100 --> 00:27:10.160
It's inconvenient to visit.

00:27:11.200 --> 00:27:13.320
I'm also worried
that the diner may be short on staff.

00:27:14.120 --> 00:27:15.140
Let's talk about it later.

00:27:15.240 --> 00:27:16.160
Well,

00:27:16.170 --> 00:27:17.140
I'll get busy first.

00:27:18.490 --> 00:27:20.220
Have a taste.

00:27:24.500 --> 00:27:25.500
There is someone at home.

00:27:25.500 --> 00:27:26.860
It's inconvenient to visit.

00:27:38.380 --> 00:27:40.180
Yu San is truly a born chef.

00:27:40.550 --> 00:27:41.620
This kind of mixed dessert

00:27:41.620 --> 00:27:43.060
actually tastes pretty good.

00:27:44.700 --> 00:27:45.740
He was ignored by us.

00:27:45.740 --> 00:27:47.140
He really looked sad.

00:27:47.420 --> 00:27:48.620
Such poor mental resilience.

00:27:48.620 --> 00:27:50.860
How could he possibly
be a professional undercover agent?

00:27:51.420 --> 00:27:53.060
From my professional perspective

00:27:53.060 --> 00:27:55.140
as a chef,

00:27:55.580 --> 00:27:57.380
I can tell this guy's cooking skills

00:27:57.740 --> 00:27:59.100
have been practiced for many years.

00:27:59.440 --> 00:28:00.310
Who do you think

00:28:00.320 --> 00:28:03.340
would teach a spy this kind
of cooking skill?

00:28:04.260 --> 00:28:06.300
What was his exact original wording?

00:28:06.820 --> 00:28:07.860
There is someone at home.

00:28:07.860 --> 00:28:09.060
It's inconvenient to visit.

00:28:09.540 --> 00:28:10.380
Let me tell you,

00:28:11.260 --> 00:28:12.900
based on my professional analysis

00:28:12.900 --> 00:28:14.050
as a genius undercover agent,

00:28:14.140 --> 00:28:15.460
there's definitely something wrong

00:28:15.460 --> 00:28:16.420
with this sentence.

00:28:16.420 --> 00:28:17.390
Think about it carefully.

00:28:17.460 --> 00:28:18.300
Isn't it?

00:28:18.360 --> 00:28:19.300
Indeed.

00:28:19.900 --> 00:28:22.590
If it's just the kind of family matters
that are hard to talk about,

00:28:22.740 --> 00:28:24.900
he could simply say
it's inconvenient to visit.

00:28:25.220 --> 00:28:26.340
There is someone at home.

00:28:26.700 --> 00:28:28.060
This sentence sounds odd.

00:28:28.220 --> 00:28:30.300
It's like someone is keeping watch
over his family.

00:28:31.180 --> 00:28:33.020
Did Prince Zhao kidnap his family

00:28:33.080 --> 00:28:34.660
and force him to be an undercover agent?

00:28:34.900 --> 00:28:36.680
My grandmother and I watched it
in the drama.

00:28:36.680 --> 00:28:37.880
It was always played like that.

00:28:39.700 --> 00:28:40.540
Yes.

00:28:55.300 --> 00:28:56.820
Lady Shen, you're looking for me.

00:29:01.580 --> 00:29:02.420
Lady Shen.

00:29:08.180 --> 00:29:09.020
Lady Shen.

00:29:11.020 --> 00:29:11.940
It's so dark.

00:29:13.620 --> 00:29:14.860
Why don't you turn on the light?

00:29:25.700 --> 00:29:26.620
Happy Birthday!

00:29:26.620 --> 00:29:27.460
Who is it?

00:29:31.660 --> 00:29:32.500
What's in his hand?

00:29:33.180 --> 00:29:34.020
It's a knife.

00:29:34.540 --> 00:29:35.380
It's a knife.

00:29:35.780 --> 00:29:36.620
Oh no!

00:29:36.780 --> 00:29:37.740
It's getting worse.

00:29:38.260 --> 00:29:39.300
He is driven to a dead end.

00:29:39.500 --> 00:29:40.940
Grandpa, Grandma,

00:29:40.940 --> 00:29:42.460
Father, Auntie,

00:29:42.460 --> 00:29:43.340
I'm scared.

00:29:43.580 --> 00:29:45.000
Don't be afraid, Yangyang.

00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:47.150
You close your eyes
before blowing out the candles.

00:29:47.160 --> 00:29:47.780
Close your eyes.

00:29:47.780 --> 00:29:49.190
Then you will not be afraid anymore.

00:29:53.780 --> 00:29:55.540
Yu San, you are really thoughtful.

00:29:55.550 --> 00:29:57.820
You guessed that we were going
to celebrate your birthday

00:29:57.830 --> 00:29:59.990
and even specially prepared a knife
to cut the cake.

00:30:02.740 --> 00:30:03.740
That's amazing.

00:30:03.740 --> 00:30:04.580
Here.

00:30:04.770 --> 00:30:05.660
Come on, cut the cake.

00:30:05.660 --> 00:30:06.580
Time to cut the cake.

00:30:08.380 --> 00:30:09.620
Come cut the cake, cut the cake.

00:30:12.540 --> 00:30:13.540
Yes.

00:30:13.540 --> 00:30:14.380
OK.

00:30:14.740 --> 00:30:17.780
- Happy Birthday.
- Happy Birthday.

00:30:20.300 --> 00:30:21.600
San, do you still remember

00:30:21.600 --> 00:30:23.730
you filled in your birthday
on your first day at work.

00:30:23.740 --> 00:30:24.800
It's just today, isn't it?

00:30:25.020 --> 00:30:26.660
Your parents aren't around.

00:30:26.660 --> 00:30:28.240
And there's no one helping you with it.

00:30:28.260 --> 00:30:29.660
So we took the liberty

00:30:29.800 --> 00:30:31.240
to celebrated your birthday for you.

00:30:31.820 --> 00:30:32.660
That's right.

00:30:41.940 --> 00:30:42.780
Yu San,

00:30:42.940 --> 00:30:44.380
actually,

00:30:44.380 --> 00:30:46.580
your age is about the same

00:30:46.740 --> 00:30:47.740
as Gongcai and Jicai.

00:30:47.740 --> 00:30:48.740
In our eyes,

00:30:48.940 --> 00:30:50.380
you are just a child.

00:30:50.660 --> 00:30:51.820
A child of our own family.

00:30:52.660 --> 00:30:54.140
- Yes.
- That's right.

00:30:54.140 --> 00:30:55.580
This birthday cake

00:30:56.020 --> 00:30:57.740
is a custom from our hometown.

00:30:58.060 --> 00:30:59.700
So, Yu San,

00:30:59.700 --> 00:31:00.900
don't despise it.

00:31:00.900 --> 00:31:01.800
- Don't mind.
- Yeah.

00:31:02.540 --> 00:31:03.500
Don't despise it.

00:31:05.100 --> 00:31:06.620
Actually, you've known about it, right?

00:31:10.400 --> 00:31:12.440
That's why your behavior
has been so strange lately.

00:31:13.220 --> 00:31:15.140
Isn't it?

00:31:15.140 --> 00:31:16.390
- Don't be impulsive.
- Speak.

00:31:16.390 --> 00:31:17.060
Isn't it?

00:31:17.300 --> 00:31:18.220
Isn't it? Isn't it?

00:31:18.220 --> 00:31:19.180
Don't...

00:31:19.180 --> 00:31:20.880
- Don't be impulsive.
- Don't be impulsive.

00:31:21.300 --> 00:31:22.500
Don't be impulsive. Don't.

00:31:22.870 --> 00:31:24.260
Yu San, don't be impulsive.

00:31:24.260 --> 00:31:25.980
- Don't be impulsive.
- Don't be afraid, Deyuan.

00:31:27.260 --> 00:31:28.980
Deyuan is just a servant girl.

00:31:30.140 --> 00:31:31.460
You're masters.

00:31:32.780 --> 00:31:34.180
You protect her like this?

00:31:34.620 --> 00:31:35.740
Deyuan is not a servant.

00:31:35.740 --> 00:31:36.580
She's our family.

00:31:37.160 --> 00:31:38.140
We went to great lengths

00:31:38.140 --> 00:31:39.260
to retrieve her slave deed,

00:31:39.260 --> 00:31:40.740
just so she could be a real person.

00:31:41.800 --> 00:31:42.820
That's just your way

00:31:42.820 --> 00:31:44.300
of winning people's hearts.

00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:47.760
Someone once said they wanted
to redeem me.

00:31:48.420 --> 00:31:49.380
But in the end,

00:31:50.020 --> 00:31:51.620
they still held my slave deed

00:31:54.500 --> 00:31:55.820
and used my family to threaten me.

00:31:58.180 --> 00:31:59.460
- Mother.
- Grandma.

00:31:59.460 --> 00:32:00.300
Grandma.

00:32:01.460 --> 00:32:02.300
Feng...

00:32:05.380 --> 00:32:06.220
San,

00:32:06.940 --> 00:32:08.260
no matter who has deceived you,

00:32:08.940 --> 00:32:10.660
but we are just ourselves.

00:32:11.090 --> 00:32:12.220
If you've been deceived once,

00:32:12.440 --> 00:32:13.740
you should walk away immediately,

00:32:13.940 --> 00:32:14.820
rather than doubt

00:32:14.820 --> 00:32:15.980
those around you.

00:32:17.020 --> 00:32:17.860
Do you know?

00:32:28.900 --> 00:32:29.900
You don't kill me?

00:32:32.470 --> 00:32:33.310
I...

00:32:33.900 --> 00:32:35.380
I am just a slave.

00:32:39.180 --> 00:32:40.540
Even though you kill me,

00:32:43.620 --> 00:32:45.260
nothing will happen to you.

00:32:46.340 --> 00:32:47.180
Yu San,

00:32:50.420 --> 00:32:52.020
you were holding this knife just now.

00:32:52.860 --> 00:32:53.700
I can see

00:32:54.140 --> 00:32:55.820
that you didn't truly intend to harm us.

00:32:56.500 --> 00:32:58.780
This shows that your conscience
has not been extinguished.

00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:02.140
If someone is truly behind you
trying to threaten you,

00:33:02.140 --> 00:33:02.980
you should choose

00:33:02.980 --> 00:33:04.980
to stand with us to deal with him,

00:33:05.490 --> 00:33:06.340
instead

00:33:06.340 --> 00:33:08.380
of risking your young life.

00:33:15.340 --> 00:33:16.680
You were the one who told them

00:33:16.680 --> 00:33:18.400
about the plan to infiltrate Yunlai,
right?

00:33:20.060 --> 00:33:21.180
Who's threatening you?

00:33:21.460 --> 00:33:22.500
Is it Prince Zhao?

00:33:25.540 --> 00:33:26.380
Yu San.

00:33:26.580 --> 00:33:27.420
Yu San.

00:33:28.020 --> 00:33:29.540
I used to work at Yunlai before.

00:33:29.860 --> 00:33:31.780
I know what kind of people they are.

00:33:32.400 --> 00:33:33.860
It must have been very tough, right?

00:33:34.380 --> 00:33:35.220
Look at me.

00:33:35.610 --> 00:33:36.460
Me.

00:33:36.460 --> 00:33:38.100
I am Handsome Shen.

00:33:38.100 --> 00:33:39.900
You must have heard of my name, right?

00:33:40.420 --> 00:33:41.240
This person

00:33:41.240 --> 00:33:42.780
is the top chef of Juxian Alley.

00:33:42.780 --> 00:33:44.100
You've heard of this title, huh?

00:33:44.220 --> 00:33:45.200
And Mr. Lin.

00:33:45.480 --> 00:33:46.580
Vice Prefect Lin.

00:33:46.580 --> 00:33:48.180
He is the upright magistrate.

00:33:48.180 --> 00:33:49.880
You've surely heard
of his title even more.

00:33:50.020 --> 00:33:51.960
Can he still not resolve the matter
behind you?

00:33:52.260 --> 00:33:53.000
Sticking with us

00:33:53.020 --> 00:33:54.690
is definitely better
than being with them.

00:33:54.700 --> 00:33:55.350
Isn't it?

00:33:56.420 --> 00:33:58.300
I remember you once said

00:33:58.440 --> 00:33:59.580
you're a slave.

00:34:00.340 --> 00:34:01.700
But you have to trust us

00:34:01.700 --> 00:34:03.100
that we will surely find a way

00:34:03.100 --> 00:34:04.420
to help you solve this problem.

00:34:04.700 --> 00:34:06.200
If money can solve this problem,

00:34:06.200 --> 00:34:07.320
we'll spend whatever it takes

00:34:07.320 --> 00:34:08.440
and exert our utmost effort;

00:34:08.440 --> 00:34:09.860
if money can't solve it,

00:34:09.860 --> 00:34:11.260
we'll still find a way.

00:34:12.020 --> 00:34:13.660
Can you trust us?

00:34:22.200 --> 00:34:23.340
Can you

00:34:24.320 --> 00:34:25.360
swear?

00:34:26.020 --> 00:34:26.860
We can.

00:34:27.150 --> 00:34:28.410
- We can.
- We can.

00:34:29.380 --> 00:34:30.220
We swear.

00:34:30.420 --> 00:34:31.260
We swear.

00:34:43.340 --> 00:34:46.260
It was I who betrayed Mr. Lin
and Mr. Shen.

00:34:47.460 --> 00:34:49.340
I'm afraid that if I make no progress,

00:34:52.700 --> 00:34:55.140
they will kill my father and mother.

00:34:56.840 --> 00:34:58.500
I have wronged you.

00:34:59.790 --> 00:35:01.900
I am a spy from Prince Zhao.

00:35:05.860 --> 00:35:06.700
I don't deserve...

00:35:07.460 --> 00:35:09.340
I don't deserve to be treated
like this by you.

00:35:11.380 --> 00:35:12.220
Sorry.

00:35:14.420 --> 00:35:15.300
Sorry.

00:35:16.540 --> 00:35:17.420
San.

00:35:17.420 --> 00:35:18.260
It's fine.

00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:20.020
It's all in the past now.

00:35:20.300 --> 00:35:21.620
It's over. It's fine now.

00:35:23.700 --> 00:35:26.740
(Prince Zhao's Mansion)

00:35:38.740 --> 00:35:40.250
What are you still standing there for?

00:35:40.460 --> 00:35:41.300
Drink it.

00:35:55.060 --> 00:35:56.300
You've had your tea.

00:35:57.140 --> 00:35:58.340
Say

00:35:58.340 --> 00:35:59.260
what you want directly.

00:36:04.020 --> 00:36:06.300
Lu Yun has already transferred out

00:36:06.360 --> 00:36:08.480
all the salt and iron
we were going to use in advance.

00:36:09.220 --> 00:36:10.820
Lin Anran hasn't found anything either.

00:36:11.620 --> 00:36:12.460
But

00:36:12.980 --> 00:36:14.220
Yunlai

00:36:14.740 --> 00:36:16.180
is no longer safe.

00:36:17.060 --> 00:36:19.100
However, rather than abandoning Yunlai,

00:36:21.780 --> 00:36:23.260
it would be better to kill Lin Yan.

00:36:23.900 --> 00:36:25.120
One finished, all is finished.

00:36:32.620 --> 00:36:34.780
Lin Yan would even oppose us
for the Shen family.

00:36:34.800 --> 00:36:36.360
If he finds out about the Cui family...

00:36:40.060 --> 00:36:41.620
Since you can't make up your mind,

00:36:44.180 --> 00:36:45.820
I'll make the decision for you.

00:36:48.140 --> 00:36:48.980
Stop.

00:36:51.220 --> 00:36:53.220
Why are you still acting so impulsively?

00:36:54.420 --> 00:36:55.260
It's easy to do.

00:36:55.260 --> 00:36:56.180
What about wrapping up?

00:36:57.420 --> 00:36:58.540
He's a Rank III official

00:36:58.540 --> 00:36:59.540
in Yong'an.

00:36:59.540 --> 00:37:00.980
You think you can easily kill him?

00:37:03.500 --> 00:37:04.420
In the final analysis,

00:37:05.940 --> 00:37:07.620
you misjudged Lin Yan.

00:37:10.620 --> 00:37:12.740
You thought he had long since
let go of the past,

00:37:12.800 --> 00:37:15.060
and that as long as he could live well,
it would be fine.

00:37:15.060 --> 00:37:16.980
But little do you know
he has his own plans.

00:37:18.300 --> 00:37:19.820
It was precisely because you projected

00:37:19.820 --> 00:37:21.260
your longing for my brother
onto him

00:37:21.260 --> 00:37:22.300
and insisted on keeping him

00:37:22.300 --> 00:37:23.840
that today's disaster was brought about.

00:37:23.840 --> 00:37:24.580
Shut up!

00:37:27.420 --> 00:37:29.660
I was worried too much,

00:37:29.660 --> 00:37:30.980
so I spoke out of turn.

00:37:31.420 --> 00:37:32.580
Please forgive me, Father.

00:37:35.620 --> 00:37:36.620
I tell you,

00:37:38.380 --> 00:37:40.820
killing would cause unnecessary trouble.

00:37:41.420 --> 00:37:42.700
His current location

00:37:43.420 --> 00:37:44.940
is too close to His Majesty.

00:37:45.780 --> 00:37:47.260
What we can do is to make him fall,

00:37:47.880 --> 00:37:48.780
falling into a position

00:37:48.790 --> 00:37:50.420
where his words don't count.

00:37:50.660 --> 00:37:51.500
Only then

00:37:51.940 --> 00:37:53.420
can you do whatever you want.

00:37:53.860 --> 00:37:55.140
Rein in your temper.

00:37:55.740 --> 00:37:56.860
Think more.

00:37:57.900 --> 00:37:58.740
Yes.

00:38:02.820 --> 00:38:04.580
(Xuanzheng Gate)

00:38:04.600 --> 00:38:06.820
Mr. Lin, you probably never expected

00:38:07.410 --> 00:38:09.820
that one day the Appeal Drum

00:38:09.980 --> 00:38:11.780
would be sounded against yourself.

00:38:13.940 --> 00:38:14.780
Your Majesty,

00:38:15.620 --> 00:38:17.550
a good citizen from the Western Market,
Feng Li,

00:38:17.560 --> 00:38:19.300
has accused Lin Yan, the Vice Prefect,

00:38:19.300 --> 00:38:21.550
of colluding with Cao Rong,
the Vice Minister of Justice,

00:38:21.560 --> 00:38:23.070
to coerce a confession through torture

00:38:23.080 --> 00:38:24.260
and render an unjust judgment.

00:38:24.260 --> 00:38:26.700
Feng Li, willing to offend the superior,

00:38:26.700 --> 00:38:28.040
subjected to corporal punishment,

00:38:28.280 --> 00:38:29.720
still seeks to redress the injustice.

00:38:46.660 --> 00:38:48.660
(Submitted by Censor Luo Zhi)

00:38:50.420 --> 00:38:51.490
How do you

00:38:51.830 --> 00:38:52.900
explain this?

00:38:54.660 --> 00:38:55.500
Your Majesty,

00:38:55.560 --> 00:38:57.330
Feng Li poisoned the Shen family's
restaurant

00:38:57.330 --> 00:38:58.620
on Juxian Alley last year.

00:38:58.620 --> 00:39:00.220
The Shen family and I are cousins.

00:39:00.220 --> 00:39:01.200
Thus, upon hearing this,

00:39:01.220 --> 00:39:02.780
in strict accordance with the Six Codes,

00:39:03.000 --> 00:39:05.260
and submitted it
to the Ministry of Justice for judgment.

00:39:05.270 --> 00:39:07.080
How could I join hands
with Vice Minister Cao?

00:39:08.660 --> 00:39:09.500
Your Majesty,

00:39:10.420 --> 00:39:12.300
in this case, both testimonial

00:39:12.300 --> 00:39:13.630
and physical evidence are present,

00:39:13.660 --> 00:39:16.020
and the judgment is rendered
strictly according to the law.

00:39:16.220 --> 00:39:17.080
Therefore,

00:39:17.080 --> 00:39:19.860
Feng Li fled in fear of punishment.

00:39:20.540 --> 00:39:22.300
Since Feng Li has retreated to Yong'an

00:39:22.660 --> 00:39:24.600
and has connected with you,

00:39:24.630 --> 00:39:26.260
why have you not
handed over the criminal

00:39:26.260 --> 00:39:28.460
to the authorities,

00:39:28.460 --> 00:39:32.020
but instead allowed him
to falsely accuse Vice Prefect Lin?

00:39:32.460 --> 00:39:34.540
What is your true intention?

00:39:34.800 --> 00:39:37.220
It's a minor dispute between merchants
in the Western Market.

00:39:37.220 --> 00:39:39.580
If it weren't for Mr. Lin mediating
between them,

00:39:39.700 --> 00:39:41.220
how could it bypass the Market Office

00:39:41.700 --> 00:39:43.140
and reach the Ministry of Justice?

00:39:43.620 --> 00:39:46.220
Could it be that you are protecting them

00:39:46.590 --> 00:39:49.500
just because the person involved
is a relative?

00:39:51.150 --> 00:39:52.500
Western Market is a prime location.

00:39:52.500 --> 00:39:53.680
Poisoning is a serious matter.

00:39:53.680 --> 00:39:55.280
How could it be considered a minor case?

00:39:55.620 --> 00:39:58.220
It used to be under the jurisdiction
of the Market Office.

00:39:58.580 --> 00:40:00.300
The Western Market was a complete mess.

00:40:00.500 --> 00:40:01.980
After this case was heavily sentenced,

00:40:02.500 --> 00:40:03.700
those merchants

00:40:03.700 --> 00:40:05.700
became much more orderly.

00:40:07.060 --> 00:40:08.140
How many errands

00:40:08.460 --> 00:40:11.100
has Capital Prefecture handled
beyond the Market Office?

00:40:11.120 --> 00:40:12.460
So mighty.

00:40:13.300 --> 00:40:14.460
I also heard

00:40:14.660 --> 00:40:16.500
the Lantern Festival had not yet ended

00:40:16.500 --> 00:40:18.860
when the Prefecture ordered people
to be on duty

00:40:19.180 --> 00:40:22.340
and even encouraged the people
to beat the Appeal Drum.

00:40:22.500 --> 00:40:23.760
The common people in the capital

00:40:24.220 --> 00:40:25.140
now

00:40:25.340 --> 00:40:26.900
only trust the Capital Prefecture.

00:40:26.900 --> 00:40:28.420
Perhaps, in their eyes,

00:40:28.560 --> 00:40:30.540
even if it were personally judged
by His Majesty,

00:40:31.340 --> 00:40:32.580
it would not compare

00:40:33.000 --> 00:40:34.920
to a single word from Mr. Lin.
