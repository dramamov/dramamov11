05:21.880 --> 05:25.970
<b>Gigantic Drill Stinger Quadruple Thrust!</b>

05:28.090 --> 05:29.680
<b>I did it...</b>

05:29.680 --> 05:31.510
<b>I did it!</b>

05:31.510 --> 05:35.730
<b>These monsters were probably a God-level threat...</b>

05:36.060 --> 05:37.060
<b>and I defeated them all by my—</b>

05:37.940 --> 05:41.230
<b>You know, when something is <i>this</i> annoying,</b>

05:41.230 --> 05:43.280
<b>it is a pleasure to watch it die.</b>

05:48.160 --> 05:50.530
<b>How much farther is J-City?</b>

05:50.530 --> 05:52.200
<b>We are almost there.</b>

05:52.200 --> 05:53.660
<b>But I am getting no readings.</b>

05:54.160 --> 05:55.330
<b>I will scout ahead.</b>

05:55.330 --> 05:57.960
<b>Once I have confirmed their location, I will let you know.</b>

05:58.880 --> 06:00.330
<b>Oh... hey!</b>

06:02.170 --> 06:05.800
<b><i>This is an announcement from the Hero Association.</i></b>

06:05.800 --> 06:09.220
<b><i>The threat level is Tiger.</i></b>

<b><i>All citizens, please stay clear of—</i></b>

<b>A-CITY - HERO ASSOCIATION HQ</b>

06:14.640 --> 06:15.810
<b>Was the warning issued?</b>

06:15.810 --> 06:17.940
<b>The request just went out.</b>

06:17.940 --> 06:22.060
<b>We'll need to update it and re-issue.</b>

06:22.060 --> 06:22.770
<b>What do you mean?</b>

06:22.770 --> 06:24.440
<b>Stinger is down.</b>

06:27.900 --> 06:31.120
<b>Mumen Rider here! I'm heading in.</b>

06:31.120 --> 06:32.700
<b>Tell me the location!</b>

06:32.700 --> 06:35.120
<b><i>All lines are busy at this time—</i></b>

06:35.120 --> 06:35.750
<b>Where are they?</b>

06:35.750 --> 06:37.960
<b>Hey, best forget it!</b>

06:38.750 --> 06:41.330
<b>Class C heroes can't handle this one.</b>

06:41.330 --> 06:42.040
<b>Huh?</b>

06:42.040 --> 06:45.050
<b>The word just came down.</b>

06:45.050 --> 06:47.210
<b><i>Emergency evacuation warning.</i></b>

06:47.210 --> 06:51.010
<b><i>The threat level has been raised from Tiger to Demon.</i></b>

<b><i>All residents of J-City,</i></b>

06:51.720 --> 06:53.100
<b>See what I mean?</b>

06:52.550 --> 06:55.140
<b><i>please evacuate immediately.</i></b>

06:55.140 --> 06:55.720
<b>Hey!</b>

06:55.720 --> 07:00.810
<b><i>I repeat. All residents of J-City, please evacuate immediately.</i></b>

07:01.690 --> 07:03.230
<b>Evacuate?</b>

07:03.230 --> 07:04.570
<b>How foolish.</b>

07:05.230 --> 07:07.990
<b>As if I'd allow even one of these apes to escape.</b>

07:11.570 --> 07:14.160
<b>So that's the one that got Stinger...</b>

07:14.870 --> 07:16.660
<b><i>But he's the last of 'em.</i></b>

07:16.660 --> 07:18.160
<b><i>Should I wait for backup?</i></b>

07:18.160 --> 07:21.620
<b><i>If it's one-on-one, maybe I can—</i></b>

07:29.800 --> 07:31.380
<b>That tingles.</b>

07:31.380 --> 07:32.930
<b>Why would you do that?</b>

07:32.930 --> 07:35.510
<b><i>Dammit, how'd he get behind me?</i></b>

07:35.510 --> 07:37.430
<b><i>I was so surprised my voice went all weird!</i></b>

07:38.060 --> 07:40.810
<b><i>Plus, my gunpowder-charged lightning kick had zero effect!</i></b>

07:40.810 --> 07:42.690
<b><i>I can't win.</i></b>

07:42.690 --> 07:44.310
<b>Who are you?</b>

07:44.650 --> 07:46.020
<b>I am...</b>

07:46.020 --> 07:48.690
<b>Lightning Max, the hero...</b>

07:48.690 --> 07:49.690
<b>Fight me!</b>

07:49.690 --> 07:53.200
<b>Fight you? Of course.</b>

07:51.610 --> 07:53.200
<b><i>I'll run for it as soon as—</i></b>

07:57.700 --> 07:59.580
<b><i>What happened?</i></b>

08:00.370 --> 08:03.080
<b><i>I can't feel my body...</i></b>

08:09.630 --> 08:10.720
<b>Dammit.</b>

08:10.720 --> 08:12.840
<b>You arrogant...</b>

08:13.880 --> 08:17.890
<b>Flying Reverse Round-House Lightning Kick!</b>

08:36.370 --> 08:38.530
<b>Class S hero,</b>

08:38.530 --> 08:40.240
<b>Puri-Puri Prisoner.</b>

08:41.000 --> 08:43.870
<b>I escaped from prison... just to see you!</b>

08:43.870 --> 08:45.120
<b>Well, well.</b>

08:45.670 --> 08:49.000
<b>A hero serving time in prison?</b>

08:49.960 --> 08:53.670
<b>I tagged along and was able to escape too.</b>

08:53.670 --> 08:54.880
<b>My thanks.</b>

08:54.880 --> 08:59.680
<b>Prisoner number 4188, Sonic-chan, right?</b>

08:59.680 --> 09:01.430
<b>Surprised I know?</b>

09:01.430 --> 09:03.810
<b>You see, I check up on all the boys who catch my eye.</b>

09:04.270 --> 09:10.020
<b>I'm serving a life sentence because I can't resist attacking beautiful men.</b>

09:10.020 --> 09:10.820
<b>Oh my.</b>

09:11.860 --> 09:15.610
<b>More soldiers came for me?</b>

09:19.330 --> 09:20.450
<b>Goodness!</b>

09:20.450 --> 09:23.040
<b>I feel the strength about to erupt out of him!</b>

09:23.040 --> 09:24.710
<b>Sonic-chan, you hang back.</b>

09:25.830 --> 09:28.500
<b>Class A rank 11, Stinger-chan.</b>

09:28.500 --> 09:30.960
<b>Class A rank 20, Lighting Max-chan.</b>

09:31.250 --> 09:34.220
<b>I fancied them both.</b>

09:34.470 --> 09:37.380
<b>And yet you ruined them!</b>

09:37.380 --> 09:40.810
<b>Now that Genos-chan has passed me, I am the lowest in rank...</b>

09:40.810 --> 09:42.850
<b>but I am still Class S!</b>

09:42.850 --> 09:44.810
<b>I am unlike either of them.</b>

09:45.310 --> 09:49.560
<b>I'll begin at half-power to 
gauge how much you can take.</b>

09:57.700 --> 10:03.330
<b>You made me rip the hand-knitted sweater my boyfriend made!</b>

10:03.330 --> 10:09.080
<b>I will never, ever forgive you!</b>

10:10.380 --> 10:13.210
<b>A delectable slab of meat, quite prime.</b>

10:13.210 --> 10:15.380
<b>I might get a little serious!</b>

10:23.060 --> 10:24.310
<b>Huh?</b>

10:24.310 --> 10:25.390
<b>Oh my...</b>

10:32.940 --> 10:35.110
<b>I felt that...</b>

10:35.110 --> 10:36.530
<b>just a little.</b>

10:36.900 --> 10:39.910
<b>I felt that too... a little.</b>

10:41.740 --> 10:46.080
<b><i>Puri-Puri Prisoner is acting tough, but he's hurting...</i></b>

10:46.080 --> 10:48.790
<b><i>So this is what a fight between a demon-level monster</i></b>

10:48.790 --> 10:51.040
<b><i>and a Class S hero looks like?</i></b>

10:51.040 --> 10:52.500
<b><i>It's almost comical.</i></b>

10:53.540 --> 10:55.500
<b><i>Neither one could defeat me.</i></b>

10:56.260 --> 10:59.930
<b><i>Dammit... His punch was stronger than I expected.</i></b>

10:59.930 --> 11:02.720
<b><i>But I must not lose to him.</i></b>

11:02.720 --> 11:07.020
<b><i>I can't have any more of my boys destroyed by this monster...</i></b>

11:07.020 --> 11:08.520
<b>I have no choice.</b>

11:09.020 --> 11:10.640
<b>I'll have to transform.</b>

11:11.650 --> 11:13.560
<b>Ready...</b>

11:13.560 --> 11:14.770
<b>Transform!</b>

11:17.440 --> 11:21.410
<b>Puri-Puri Prisoner Angel Style!</b>

11:22.620 --> 11:23.660
<b><i>He's naked.</i></b>

11:24.160 --> 11:26.160
<b><i>And he's definitely no angel.</i></b>

11:26.160 --> 11:27.910
<b><i>Nor is he human.</i></b>

11:27.910 --> 11:29.580
<b><i>Nor do I want to watch.</i></b>

11:29.580 --> 11:30.410
<b><i>I'm out.</i></b>

11:30.410 --> 11:34.420
<b>No one has ever seen my Angel Style and lived to tell the tale.</b>

11:34.840 --> 11:36.960
<b><i>All the more reason to leave.</i></b>

11:37.300 --> 11:39.470
<b>Quite unsightly.</b>

11:39.470 --> 11:43.840
<b>Are those... your last words?</b>

11:49.680 --> 11:52.770
<b>Angel Rush!</b>

12:00.900 --> 12:03.740
<b>Elevated energy levels nearby.</b>

12:03.740 --> 12:04.950
<b>That must be it.</b>

12:07.620 --> 12:11.460
<b>Damn it! I have no way to reach Sensei!</b>

12:11.460 --> 12:12.830
<b>It cannot be helped.</b>

12:20.670 --> 12:24.550
<b>Done with your combo?</b>

12:27.390 --> 12:30.060
<b>I felt that... a little.</b>

12:37.360 --> 12:38.320
<b>Listen.</b>

12:38.320 --> 12:42.820
<b>The objective of a combination 
move is to finish your opponent.</b>

12:42.820 --> 12:46.620
<b>Each separate attack must be 
delivered with the intent to kill.</b>

12:46.620 --> 12:48.990
<b>Like this!</b>

12:57.080 --> 12:59.420
<b>Isn't this fun?</b>

12:59.420 --> 13:01.710
<b>Just who are you?</b>

13:01.710 --> 13:03.760
<b>I am the Deep Sea King.</b>

13:03.760 --> 13:07.850
<b>As lord of the Clan of the Seafolk, 
this world is mine to rule.</b>

13:08.600 --> 13:11.100
<b>Do you dare defy me too?</b>

13:12.060 --> 13:15.730
<b>You think you have the strength 
to rule the surface all alone?</b>

13:15.730 --> 13:16.850
<b>That's pathetic.</b>

13:16.850 --> 13:18.110
<b>Oh?</b>

13:18.110 --> 13:20.690
<b>Then I suppose you must die.</b>

13:20.690 --> 13:22.230
<b>That's my line.</b>

13:22.230 --> 13:27.280
<b>I would have let you live if you'd shown me the respect I'm due.</b>

13:27.950 --> 13:31.240
<b>I'm no hero, but I will eliminate you.</b>

13:31.870 --> 13:34.500
<b>The rain... is falling.</b>

13:38.170 --> 13:39.380
<b>Too slow!</b>

13:40.290 --> 13:41.670
<b>Wind Blade Kick!</b>

13:42.710 --> 13:46.760
<b>Deep Sea King, I see right through your moves.</b>

13:48.430 --> 13:50.010
<b>Are you sure of that?</b>

13:50.510 --> 13:53.890
<b>Once it bites, my little moray here never lets go!</b>

13:55.850 --> 13:57.440
<b>Let me be clear.</b>

13:57.440 --> 14:00.020
<b>There's no way I'd ever lose to you.</b>

14:05.440 --> 14:06.740
<b>It's useless.</b>

14:06.740 --> 14:08.320
<b>You may have power...</b>

14:11.830 --> 14:15.500
<b>but you're too slow to fight me.</b>

14:16.120 --> 14:18.080
<b>I'm glad, Deep Sea King!</b>

14:18.080 --> 14:22.210
<b>Fighting something like you just confirms how strong I really am!</b>

14:23.880 --> 14:26.880
<b>You see, my moves are the fastest and the strongest!</b>

14:31.010 --> 14:33.100
<b>Now what, lost your mind?</b>

14:36.930 --> 14:37.890
<b><i>He's faster!</i></b>

14:40.560 --> 14:42.020
<b><i>Stronger too?!</i></b>

14:42.020 --> 14:44.650
<b>What happened to him?</b>

14:46.490 --> 14:47.900
<b><i>He's huge!</i></b>

14:47.900 --> 14:51.740
<b>The air of the surface shriveled me up a bit,</b>

14:51.740 --> 14:55.160
<b>but thanks to this rain, I feel like myself again.</b>

14:55.160 --> 14:58.910
<b>Your attacks don't hurt me... even a little!</b>

15:13.640 --> 15:14.470
<b><i>At this time,</i></b>

15:14.470 --> 15:19.310
<b><i>the whereabouts of the Seafolk 
that attacked J-City are unknown.</i></b>

15:19.310 --> 15:21.940
<b><i>Several heroes who tried to stop them</i></b>

15:21.940 --> 15:24.360
<b><i>have been found unconscious at the scene</i></b>

15:24.360 --> 15:26.780
<b><i>and remain in critical condition.</i></b>

15:28.400 --> 15:31.360
<b>Of all the times to hit a red light...</b>

15:31.360 --> 15:33.950
<b>Where'd he run off to?</b>

15:35.660 --> 15:37.490
<b>Wait, you're...</b>

15:37.490 --> 15:39.160
<b>Class C, rank 2.</b>

15:39.160 --> 15:40.750
<b>Are you a hero too?</b>

15:41.580 --> 15:43.170
<b>Have you seen Genos?</b>

15:43.170 --> 15:44.670
<b>Genos?</b>

15:44.670 --> 15:49.380
<b><i>Today, as our guest, we have 
the top-ranked Class A superhero</i></b>

15:49.380 --> 15:52.680
<b><i>who has also been number one in popularity rankings</i></b>

15:52.680 --> 15:53.930
<b><i>for 28 weeks straight.</i></b>

15:53.930 --> 15:58.930
<b><i>He's also a successful model, actor and singer.</i></b>

15:58.930 --> 16:01.890
<b><i>Let's welcome the handsome Amai Mask-san!</i></b>

16:03.100 --> 16:04.980
<b>Thank you for having me.</b>

16:05.480 --> 16:10.110
<b>We are currently facing a threat level of Demon.</b>

16:10.110 --> 16:11.860
<b>How do you assess the situation?</b>

16:12.910 --> 16:14.870
<b>That is a difficult question.</b>

16:14.870 --> 16:16.780
<b>Why is that?</b>

16:16.780 --> 16:20.950
<b>I'm only a hero when I confront evil.</b>

16:20.950 --> 16:24.370
<b>The rest of the time, 
I'm focused on my career as an artist.</b>

16:24.370 --> 16:25.500
<b>I see.</b>

16:25.500 --> 16:29.340
<b>I'm only here today to promote my new song.</b>

16:29.340 --> 16:31.090
<b>My apologies.</b>

16:31.090 --> 16:34.720
<b>In that case, let's discuss your song.</b>

16:34.720 --> 16:38.350
<b>Let me just say this.</b>

16:39.060 --> 16:41.520
<b>To assuage the public's fears and worries,</b>

16:41.520 --> 16:45.100
<b>heroes need to be both tough and strong</b>

16:45.100 --> 16:52.240
<b>so that they can defeat evil 
with speed, grace and brilliance.</b>

16:52.240 --> 16:54.910
<b>I find it regrettable that there were heroes</b>

16:54.910 --> 16:57.910
<b>who were completely beaten by evil this time.</b>

16:57.910 --> 17:01.040
<b>So that no hero ever dies in vain,</b>

17:01.040 --> 17:04.210
<b>I hope everyone will continue to train their hardest.</b>

17:05.620 --> 17:07.630
<b>My attacks have no effect.</b>

17:07.630 --> 17:08.880
<b>Could I be lacking in power?</b>

17:09.630 --> 17:11.380
<b>I can't kill him unarmed.</b>

17:11.380 --> 17:14.420
<b>I need to retreat for now and find a weapon.</b>

17:15.680 --> 17:17.510
<b>Caught you!</b>

17:19.010 --> 17:21.680
<b>Crack crack, snap snap.</b>

17:23.350 --> 17:24.310
<b>Huh?</b>

17:24.310 --> 17:25.270
<b>Wait there.</b>

17:27.770 --> 17:30.820
<b>The next time we meet will be your demise.</b>

17:32.780 --> 17:34.400
<b>No matter.</b>

17:34.400 --> 17:36.990
<b>The small fry can be let go.</b>

17:42.080 --> 17:43.540
<b>Who are you?</b>

17:43.540 --> 17:44.750
<b>What are you doing here?</b>

17:45.620 --> 17:47.250
<b>There were orders to evacuate.</b>

17:48.000 --> 17:49.540
<b>A hero?</b>

17:49.540 --> 17:52.000
<b>If you're after the Deep Sea King, you better forget it.</b>

17:52.000 --> 17:53.340
<b>Deep Sea King?</b>

17:53.340 --> 17:56.880
<b>You heroes could all jump him at once and still lose.</b>

17:56.880 --> 17:59.390
<b>You're fine at playing make-believe,</b>

17:59.390 --> 18:01.310
<b>but you don't stand a chance against true power.</b>

18:01.310 --> 18:03.470
<b>You can't protect a thing.</b>

18:06.980 --> 18:09.100
<b>Who was that pervert?</b>

18:10.610 --> 18:11.770
<b>The Seafolk?!</b>

18:12.440 --> 18:15.190
<b>I sense numerous life signals nearby.</b>

18:15.190 --> 18:16.780
<b>With so many...</b>

18:17.450 --> 18:19.030
<b>The evacuation shelter!</b>

18:21.580 --> 18:25.200
<b>Daddy, are the scary monsters still outside?</b>

18:25.200 --> 18:29.790
<b>Don't worry. As long as we're in this shelter, we're safe.</b>

18:29.790 --> 18:31.460
<b>Besides... if it comes down to it,</b>

18:31.460 --> 18:35.050
<b>I'm sure all of us together can beat a monster or two!</b>

18:37.880 --> 18:39.340
<b><i>I sense them...</i></b>

18:39.340 --> 18:41.260
<b><i>So many humans!</i></b>

18:42.260 --> 18:44.390
<b><i>It's coming from...</i></b>

18:44.390 --> 18:45.970
<b><i>over there!</i></b>

18:52.770 --> 18:54.980
<b>Greetings...</b>

18:54.980 --> 18:57.030
<b>and goodbye.</b>

18:58.650 --> 19:00.820
<b>P-Please wait!</b>

19:01.410 --> 19:03.450
<b>We surrender!</b>

19:03.450 --> 19:06.080
<b>We will comply with any demands you have.</b>

19:06.450 --> 19:09.080
<b>But please do not attack. I beg you.</b>

19:09.960 --> 19:14.090
<b><i>I'm only Class C, so I evacuated. Now I'm trapped!</i></b>

19:14.090 --> 19:17.170
<b><i>I'm no hero. I'm a failure...</i></b>

19:17.170 --> 19:18.720
<b>Surrender?</b>

19:20.380 --> 19:23.600
<b>I've come to kill you. Your deaths are inevitable!</b>

19:24.640 --> 19:27.310
<b>And as for my demands...</b>

19:27.310 --> 19:31.600
<b>How about I <i>demand</i> you scream nicely as I slaughter you?</b>

19:32.060 --> 19:33.520
<b><i>I can't win...</i></b>

19:33.520 --> 19:34.770
<b><i>I know it won't amount to much,</i></b>

19:34.770 --> 19:38.440
<b><i>but all I can do is buy time for the Class S heroes to get here.</i></b>

19:38.440 --> 19:40.860
<b><i>But look at this monster...</i></b>

19:40.860 --> 19:42.610
<b><i>Who am I kidding?</i></b>

19:43.370 --> 19:46.830
<b><i>I can't buy time just by talking to him.</i></b>

19:48.410 --> 19:50.330
<b><i>I pissed my pants...</i></b>

19:50.330 --> 19:51.750
<b><i>I'm pathetic.</i></b>

19:53.380 --> 19:54.630
<b>I'll fight with you!</b>

19:54.630 --> 19:55.960
<b><i>Heroes?</i></b>

19:55.960 --> 19:57.630
<b><i>There are others in here too?</i></b>

19:58.300 --> 20:01.510
<b>I may be the lowest ranking at 38,</b>

20:01.510 --> 20:03.800
<b>but I'm still a Class A hero.</b>

20:03.800 --> 20:05.260
<b>We can do this.</b>

20:05.260 --> 20:07.640
<b>I-I'm a hero too!</b>

20:07.640 --> 20:09.020
<b>Allback-man is here!</b>

20:09.470 --> 20:10.390
<b>Heroes?</b>

20:10.390 --> 20:11.940
<b>The heroes are here?</b>

20:11.940 --> 20:12.890
<b>Heroes!</b>

20:12.890 --> 20:14.270
<b>They'll save us!</b>

20:14.270 --> 20:17.440
<b>I feel better with a Class A around.</b>

20:17.440 --> 20:18.610
<b>Yeah.</b>

20:18.610 --> 20:23.160
<b><i>Two Class C's, one Class B and one Class A...</i></b>

20:23.160 --> 20:24.320
<b><i>We can do it!</i></b>

20:24.320 --> 20:25.370
<b><i>We can win!</i></b>

20:28.700 --> 20:30.450
<b>You sure this is the way?</b>

20:30.450 --> 20:33.620
<b>Yes. Since residents are fleeing from this direction,</b>

20:34.120 --> 20:35.750
<b>we'll find monsters further up.</b>

20:37.920 --> 20:40.420
<b>Did you just see a butt-naked guy run past?</b>

20:40.420 --> 20:41.380
<b>What?</b>

20:41.380 --> 20:43.630
<b>Maybe he was taking a bath and was left behind.</b>

20:44.010 --> 20:45.510
<b>I'll check it out.</b>

20:45.510 --> 20:47.100
<b>Go on without me!</b>

20:47.100 --> 20:48.010
<b>Got it!</b>

20:49.890 --> 20:51.310
<b>Mumen Rider here.</b>

20:51.310 --> 20:54.480
<b>Yes, we're on our way.</b>

20:54.480 --> 20:56.440
<b>What?! The shelter?</b>

20:56.940 --> 20:58.650
<b>It was the other way!</b>

21:07.620 --> 21:11.160
<b>All right. When I give the signal, charge him.</b>

21:14.160 --> 21:15.290
<b>One...</b>

21:16.790 --> 21:17.960
<b>Two...</b>

21:18.460 --> 21:22.260
<b>That's weird. I know I saw him...</b>

21:34.230 --> 21:37.020
<b>Why so quiet all of a sudden?</b>

21:37.020 --> 21:39.560
<b>Are you one of the Seafolk?</b>

21:44.240 --> 21:46.070
<b>Mumen Rider went in?</b>

21:46.070 --> 21:48.030
<b>Yes. I couldn't stop—</b>

21:48.030 --> 21:49.370
<b>Mumen Rider-kun?!</b>

21:49.370 --> 21:50.660
<b>What's your location?</b>

21:50.660 --> 21:52.790
<b><i>This is beyond you.</i></b>

21:52.790 --> 21:55.160
<b><i>The monster even took out a Class S hero!</i></b>

21:55.540 --> 21:58.420
<b><i>We need to assemble a subjugation squad.</i></b>

21:58.420 --> 22:00.790
<b>A Class S hero was defeated?</b>

22:00.790 --> 22:01.800
<b><i>Who is this?</i></b>

22:02.170 --> 22:03.960
<b>Where's Mumen Rider-kun?</b>

22:06.050 --> 22:07.590
<b>Riding-Out-of-the-Saddle Mode!</b>

22:08.130 --> 22:11.100
<b>Roar, Justice!</b>

22:11.100 --> 22:13.560
<b>Is this the Hero Association?</b>

22:13.560 --> 22:16.100
<b><i>Yes. Who are you?</i></b>

22:16.100 --> 22:19.020
<b>Get me the owner of that cell phone right now!</b>

22:19.020 --> 22:21.610
