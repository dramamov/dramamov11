<b>Let's withdraw for now...</b>

07:43.480 --> 07:47.400
<b>and think of a different way to destroy it, like with heat or something!</b>

07:47.400 --> 07:51.150
<b>Smashing is all I can do! Forget it!</b>

07:51.530 --> 07:54.160
<b>This is all I know, too.</b>

07:54.160 --> 07:57.160
<b>Can't teach an old dog new tricks.</b>

07:57.410 --> 08:00.910
<b>Me, too. Sorry, Iaian-chan!</b>

08:00.910 --> 08:04.920
<b>Iai, don't you have faith in me?</b>

08:04.920 --> 08:06.920
<b>There's nothing I can't cut down!</b>

08:08.420 --> 08:09.920
<b><i>It's pointless...</i></b>

08:10.550 --> 08:14.970
<b><i>These guys aren't the type to listen.</i></b>

08:19.390 --> 08:20.560
<b><i>Melzalgald!</i></b>

08:20.560 --> 08:22.600
<b><i>Look, I </i>really<i> need you on the ship!</i></b>

08:22.600 --> 08:25.060
<b><i>Getting rid of the intruder takes priority.</i></b>

08:25.480 --> 08:30.070
<b><i>I'd love to, but I'm busy. 
These creatures are persistent.</i></b>

08:30.070 --> 08:31.690
<b>What the hell?</b>

08:31.690 --> 08:36.030
<b><i>The life forms down there are 
proving tough to handle, too?</i></b>

08:36.030 --> 08:38.410
<b><i>Nothing tough about them.</i></b>

08:38.410 --> 08:41.040
<b><i>What's with the ship? Is it going down?</i></b>

08:42.500 --> 08:44.040
<b>It's not going down,</b>

08:44.040 --> 08:47.210
<b>but more than half the crew have been killed.</b>

08:47.210 --> 08:48.420
<b><i>What?!</i></b>

08:51.420 --> 08:54.260
<b><i>Listen. Begin cleansing my location</i></b>

08:54.260 --> 08:56.550
<b><i>with a bombardment from the ship!</i></b>

08:56.970 --> 08:59.600
<b>I've got my hands full right now!</b>

08:59.600 --> 09:02.980
<b>Besides, artillery bombardment is the lower ranks' job.</b>

09:02.980 --> 09:06.480
<b><i>Well, I'm in a situation where I can't return to the ship.</i></b>

09:06.480 --> 09:07.560
<b>All right.</b>

09:07.560 --> 09:10.320
<b>I'll notify the artillery crews.</b>

09:10.320 --> 09:12.900
<b>Don't get caught up in the barrage and die!</b>

09:13.570 --> 09:15.320
<b>Hey, wait!</b>

09:17.950 --> 09:20.950
<b><i>You should come down here and help me.</i></b>

09:20.950 --> 09:23.410
<b><i>That'd be much faster.</i></b>

09:23.410 --> 09:25.960
<b><i>Oi! Geryuganshoop!</i></b>

09:26.750 --> 09:30.420
<b><i>Damn him. How tough is this intruder?</i></b>

09:32.840 --> 09:35.800
<b>How about another one?!</b>

09:38.300 --> 09:39.930
<b>More futile attacks.</b>

09:39.930 --> 09:43.810
<b>Although you are exhausting yourself. That is good.</b>

09:46.270 --> 09:47.600
<b>The hell is this?</b>

09:52.480 --> 09:55.360
<b>A marble? Why've you got this?</b>

09:56.990 --> 09:58.280
<b>Give it back!</b>

09:58.280 --> 09:59.620
<b>Sure thing.</b>

10:04.910 --> 10:05.790
<b>Damn!</b>

10:05.790 --> 10:09.540
<b>That's gross, ya nasty bastard! You dead?</b>

10:09.540 --> 10:14.550
<b>Hey, this guy's got marble-looking things inside him.</b>

10:14.550 --> 10:16.300
<b>That's where ya hurt him!</b>

10:18.720 --> 10:19.760
<b>Oh!</b>

10:19.760 --> 10:20.800
<b>Nice work.</b>

10:21.180 --> 10:26.430
<b>So I just have to keep slicing until I hit a vital marble!</b>

10:30.770 --> 10:32.020
<b><i>Impossible!</i></b>

10:32.020 --> 10:34.690
<b><i>I've been growing that head for a hundred years!</i></b>

10:34.690 --> 10:36.740
<b><i>It died in a dump like this?</i></b>

10:38.490 --> 10:42.070
<b><i>But you scum are all dead when the shells hit.</i></b>

10:42.070 --> 10:44.990
<b><i>They're on their way!</i></b>

10:51.080 --> 10:53.090
<b><i>Attention, intruder!</i></b>

10:53.090 --> 10:56.090
<b><i>Stop your destructive acts and leave this instant.</i></b>

10:56.090 --> 10:57.420
<b><i>Attention, intruder!</i></b>

10:57.420 --> 10:59.010
<b><i>Leave immediately.</i></b>

10:59.380 --> 11:03.470
<b><i>Otherwise, we will unleash 
all of our forces against you!</i></b>

11:03.470 --> 11:04.930
<b>That's weird.</b>

11:04.930 --> 11:08.020
<b>I hear a voice right inside my head.</b>

11:08.020 --> 11:10.270
<b><i>Take one more step...</i></b>

11:10.270 --> 11:12.100
<b><i>...and you're dead!</i></b>

11:12.100 --> 11:13.480
<b>Even if I wanted to get out,</b>

11:13.480 --> 11:16.440
<b>I can't. I've lost my way!</b>

11:16.780 --> 11:18.320
<b>Really? You'll leave?</b>

11:18.320 --> 11:20.240
<b>All right, I will guide you.</b>

11:20.950 --> 11:25.450
<b><i>Take a right, then go up the stairs there.</i></b>

11:25.450 --> 11:26.490
<b>A right?</b>

11:27.040 --> 11:29.080
<b><i>Exactly, a right.</i></b>

11:30.920 --> 11:33.000
<b>I guess I'll go left!</b>

11:33.000 --> 11:35.000
<b><i>No, wait! Not that way!</i></b>

11:35.000 --> 11:38.590
<b>W-W-Wait... Hang on! You can't...!</b>

11:38.590 --> 11:40.720
<b><i>All right, that was my fault!</i></b>

11:40.720 --> 11:44.470
<b><i>I'll come to you. Please stay right there!</i></b>

11:44.470 --> 11:47.220
<b><i>Ahh! Don't go in there!</i></b>

11:51.230 --> 11:54.480
<b>Now this place looks like a 
control room or something.</b>

11:54.480 --> 11:55.730
<b>You...</b>

11:59.030 --> 12:00.030
<b>An octopus?</b>

12:02.740 --> 12:07.280
<b>You dare to go around destroying our ship?</b>

12:09.200 --> 12:11.580
<b>Hey! The debris is all flying at me!</b>

12:13.750 --> 12:18.500
<b>Now I, Geryuganshoop, the most supreme telekinetic power in the universe,</b>

12:18.500 --> 12:20.710
<b>will grind you into a bloody sausage!</b>

12:47.990 --> 12:50.660
<b>Just about there.</b>

12:50.660 --> 12:53.790
<b>Geryuganshoop-sama, 
preparations for the bombardment</b>

12:53.790 --> 12:54.960
<b>are nearly complete.</b>

12:54.960 --> 12:56.670
<b>Shall I proceed?</b>

12:59.170 --> 13:02.630
<b>Maybe he went to the bathroom...</b>

13:05.550 --> 13:08.050
<b>Hey, Geryuganshoop-sama!</b>

13:08.390 --> 13:11.560
<b>Telekinetic power... like a psychic?</b>

13:12.730 --> 13:14.940
<b>You leave me no choice.</b>

13:14.940 --> 13:16.940
<b>Super Telekinetic Gravitational Wave!</b>

13:18.690 --> 13:21.110
<b>Die, Earthling!</b>

13:25.740 --> 13:29.030
<b>My unparalleled telekinetic powers allow me</b>

13:29.030 --> 13:32.330
<b>to manipulate even the forces of gravity!</b>

13:32.330 --> 13:35.830
<b>Have you any idea what a black hole is, you ape?</b>

13:35.830 --> 13:38.880
<b>Inside one, the gravitational effects are so strong</b>

13:38.880 --> 13:41.380
<b>even light itself cannot escape!</b>

13:41.380 --> 13:42.340
<b>What's this?</b>

13:54.640 --> 13:56.140
<b>Now what?</b>

13:56.690 --> 13:59.400
<b>Take this! Telekinetic Shower of Rubble!</b>

14:09.160 --> 14:10.700
<b>I got him!</b>

14:12.410 --> 14:15.250
<b>What a waste of psychic powers.</b>

14:15.250 --> 14:18.080
<b>I mean, all you're doing is tossing pebbles around.</b>

14:18.080 --> 14:20.580
<b>Anyone can do that.</b>

14:21.750 --> 14:23.300
<b>How... could...</b>

14:23.300 --> 14:25.420
<b>I... Geryuganshoop...</b>

14:25.420 --> 14:27.590
<b>be...</b>

14:30.550 --> 14:31.100
<b>Excuse me?</b>

14:33.140 --> 14:35.100
<b>Can I ask...</b>

14:35.680 --> 14:37.770
<b>...where your boss is?</b>

14:42.520 --> 14:43.980
<b>This looks bad.</b>

14:50.320 --> 14:51.990
<b>Is that confirmed?</b>

14:51.990 --> 14:55.620
<b><i>Yes, Child Emperor said that the energy level in</i></b>

14:55.620 --> 14:58.910
<b><i>the spaceship is rapidly rising.</i></b>

14:58.910 --> 15:01.630
<b>Yes, but the civilians—</b>

15:01.630 --> 15:04.210
<b>Recall the search and rescue teams for now.</b>

15:04.210 --> 15:06.590
<b>Have everyone take cover.</b>

15:06.590 --> 15:08.630
<b>You'll be taking fire soon!</b>

15:20.940 --> 15:22.020
<b>Hold on!</b>

15:26.780 --> 15:28.400
<b>There we go.</b>

15:28.400 --> 15:30.900
<b>Geryuganshoop-sama still 
hasn't gotten back to me...</b>

15:30.900 --> 15:32.360
<b>but whatever.</b>

15:32.360 --> 15:33.530
<b>Let's see...</b>

15:34.320 --> 15:38.250
<b>I believe the order was to concentrate fire</b>

15:38.250 --> 15:41.080
<b>around the enemies on the 
surface near Melzalgald-sama.</b>

15:46.630 --> 15:48.300
<b>Two heads to go!</b>

15:48.300 --> 15:50.050
<b>I'll bust 'em wide open!</b>

15:50.050 --> 15:51.470
<b>Is it time?</b>

15:51.470 --> 15:54.050
<b>Ship, bombardment, coming...</b>

15:56.310 --> 15:58.350
<b>Found ya.</b>

15:58.350 --> 15:59.350
<b>All right...</b>

15:59.350 --> 16:00.270
<b>Click!</b>

16:05.730 --> 16:07.070
<b>It's over.</b>

16:07.070 --> 16:09.740
<b>Evasion, impossible. Instant death.</b>

16:21.250 --> 16:23.870
<b>Huh... What happened?</b>

16:25.040 --> 16:26.170
<b>What the—?</b>

16:26.170 --> 16:27.670
<b>They stopped.</b>

16:28.630 --> 16:31.800
<b>All of you would be dead without me.</b>

16:31.800 --> 16:34.180
<b>Can't you even finish one small fry?</b>

16:34.180 --> 16:37.390
<b>Maybe try starting over from Class C.</b>

16:43.520 --> 16:45.100
<b>You can have...</b>

16:45.100 --> 16:46.480
<b>your shells back.</b>

16:55.660 --> 16:57.620
<b>Th-This is...</b>

17:05.420 --> 17:06.920
<b>I wanna go home.</b>

17:11.800 --> 17:14.340
<b>I didn't expect you to be here.</b>

17:14.340 --> 17:17.140
<b>Thank you, Mumen Rider-kun.</b>

17:17.140 --> 17:20.010
<b>Which areas are likely to have survivors?</b>

17:20.310 --> 17:22.350
<b>There must be more out there.</b>

17:22.350 --> 17:24.270
<b>But you...</b>

17:24.270 --> 17:26.270
<b>I'll go rescue them right now.</b>

17:26.270 --> 17:29.230
<b>We want to know, too.</b>

17:29.230 --> 17:32.030
<b>Yeah, can't let him hog the limelight.</b>

17:32.650 --> 17:34.780
<b>Stinger, Lightning Max...</b>

17:34.780 --> 17:37.530
<b>Mind if we borrow this?</b>

17:37.990 --> 17:39.280
<b>You guys...</b>

17:53.460 --> 17:54.880
<b>Nice catch.</b>

18:04.100 --> 18:05.520
<b>Found it...</b>

18:05.520 --> 18:06.310
<b>Smash.</b>

18:08.480 --> 18:10.190
<b>One left!</b>

18:16.400 --> 18:17.900
<b>Silver Fang!</b>

18:18.740 --> 18:21.160
<b>A... direct hit.</b>

18:27.710 --> 18:29.540
<b>Weak, weak!</b>

18:29.540 --> 18:32.210
<b>You are all so very weak.</b>

18:32.210 --> 18:34.670
<b>Dead after a single hit!</b>

18:34.670 --> 18:37.420
<b>A change of tactics was all I needed.</b>

18:37.420 --> 18:40.930
<b>If I forget defense and focus on attack,</b>

18:40.930 --> 18:43.140
<b>this will all be over quickly.</b>

18:43.140 --> 18:44.930
<b>And you're next!</b>

18:47.270 --> 18:50.940
<b>I will spring past that sword and squeeze your skull 'til it pops.</b>

18:51.610 --> 18:55.440
<b>Think so? Then be my guest.</b>

19:06.410 --> 19:07.790
<b>So he's come.</b>

19:36.650 --> 19:39.440
<b><i>This planet's finest warrior...</i></b>

<b>You the boss of these invaders?</b>

19:47.240 --> 19:48.620
<b>Wonderful!</b>

19:50.410 --> 19:53.540
<b>Before we fight, let us exchange names.</b>

19:56.170 --> 20:00.510
<b>I lead the pirate group known as Dark Matter,</b>

<b>and am Dominator of the Universe. I am Boros.</b>

<b>I'm a hero for fu— I mean,</b>

20:06.680 --> 20:08.430
<b>a professional hero.</b>

20:08.430 --> 20:09.890
<b>My name's Saitama.</b>

20:10.350 --> 20:11.940
<b>Saitama...</b>

20:11.940 --> 20:14.350
<b>Look, I don't know what the

20:14.350 --> 20:16.150
<b>wants with Earth...</b>

20:16.150 --> 20:19.530
<b>...but you sure trashed A-City.</b>

20:20.610 --> 20:22.650
<b>What I want with Earth?</b>

20:25.410 --> 20:27.160
<b>There exists a prophecy.</b>

20:27.160 --> 20:29.660
<b>Prophecy? You mean...</b>

20:30.910 --> 20:34.920
<b>I once traveled the universe, 
ravaging everything in sight.</b>

20:36.500 --> 20:39.170
<b>But I was too strong.</b>

20:39.170 --> 20:43.130
<b>Eventually, there were none left who could face me.</b>

20:43.130 --> 20:47.180
<b>I came to know the torment of utter, all-encompassing boredom.</b>

20:47.720 --> 20:51.430
<b>Then one day, a seer told me this:</b>

20:51.430 --> 20:53.770
<b>On a faraway planet,</b>

20:53.770 --> 20:55.480
<b>a being exists who is my match,</b>

20:55.480 --> 20:58.690
<b>one who could rekindle my passion for battle.</b>

20:58.980 --> 21:02.150
<b>That was nearly twenty years ago.</b>

21:02.150 --> 21:06.160
<b>Have you any idea the distance 
I have traveled to get here?</b>

21:06.700 --> 21:09.700
<b>My men thought the prophecy was a ruse,</b>

21:09.700 --> 21:13.710
<b>made up to lure me away...</b>

21:13.710 --> 21:16.040
<b>But now I am certain.</b>

21:16.040 --> 21:19.710
<b>Come. Breathe life into my very existence.</b>

21:19.710 --> 21:21.710
<b><i>That</i> is why I am here!</b>

21:26.760 --> 21:28.720
<b>Are you stupid?</b>

21:28.720 --> 21:31.140
<b>You can't just go around attacking other planets</b>

21:31.140 --> 21:33.180
<b>just to liven up your boring life.</b>
