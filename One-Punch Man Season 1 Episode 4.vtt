<b>But you're a bodyguard—</b>

06:52.350 --> 06:53.640
<b>Oh, Sonic!</b>

06:54.010 --> 06:56.020
<b>Can I leave this to you?</b>

06:56.310 --> 06:57.270
<b>The men coming are—</b>

06:58.390 --> 06:59.850
<b>Of course.</b>

07:00.600 --> 07:02.980
<b>It's their lives you should worry about.</b>

07:02.980 --> 07:07.690
<b>But please do think of a way to 
dispose of the pile of dead bodies.</b>

07:08.820 --> 07:10.110
<b><i>The Paradisers...</i></b>

07:10.110 --> 07:14.740
<b><i>A bunch of upstarts equipped with 
some new type of battle suit.</i></b>

07:14.740 --> 07:17.620
<b><i>And B-class criminal Hammerhead.</i></b>

07:17.620 --> 07:20.410
<b><i>He might have some backbone.</i></b>

07:20.410 --> 07:24.920

07:20.410 --> 07:24.920
The Modern Ninja

07:26.920 --> 07:31.630
<b>Boss, you can see Zeniru's building across the woods.</b>

07:31.630 --> 07:34.680
<b>People call it the Golden Turd.</b>

07:36.140 --> 07:37.680
<b>All right, let's go!</b>

07:45.690 --> 07:47.320
<b>Something's here.</b>

07:48.530 --> 07:50.950
<b>I've been waiting for you, Hammerhead.</b>

07:52.570 --> 07:54.620
<b>Zeniru sent me.</b>

07:57.120 --> 07:59.330
<b>Let me start out by saying</b>

07:59.330 --> 08:03.790
<b>no opponent of mine has ever escaped alive.</b>

08:03.790 --> 08:05.670
<b>I plan on keeping it that way.</b>

08:05.670 --> 08:08.590
<b>When it comes to my job, I'm a perfectionist.</b>

08:08.590 --> 08:10.210
<b>But if you surrender right now,</b>

08:10.210 --> 08:12.220
<b>I'll let you live.</b>

08:12.930 --> 08:15.180
<b>So, what will it be?</b>

08:45.120 --> 08:46.290
<b><i>What is this?</i></b>

08:49.460 --> 08:51.170
<b><i>What's going on?</i></b>

08:51.170 --> 08:52.010
<b>Why is every—</b>

08:57.220 --> 08:59.180
<b><i>Nooo!</i></b>

09:00.510 --> 09:03.100
<b>Bastard!</b>

09:09.980 --> 09:13.280
<b>What's this now? Trying to intimidate me?</b>

09:13.860 --> 09:15.610
<b>You can't see me, can you?</b>

09:17.030 --> 09:19.280
<b>There you are!</b>

09:23.000 --> 09:24.250
<b>It's a terrorist!</b>

09:24.250 --> 09:25.750
<b>No, I'm not!</b>

09:32.050 --> 09:34.670
<b><i>So he decided to fight instead of run.</i></b>

09:43.680 --> 09:46.940
<b><i>Oops, there goes my bad habit again.</i></b>

09:48.310 --> 09:50.940
<b>You're just a little dog bought by Zeniru's money.</b>

09:50.940 --> 09:54.190
<b>You think someone like me, 
who fights for a noble cause,</b>

09:54.190 --> 09:57.070
<b>can lose to a dog?!</b>

09:57.070 --> 09:59.660
<b><i>Yes, I see what he's up to.</i></b>

09:59.660 --> 10:02.080
<b><i>Just as I thought, he's a complete fool.</i></b>

10:02.080 --> 10:04.040
<b><i>Couldn't he have at least</i></b>

10:04.040 --> 10:06.080
<b><i>tried to arrange the rocks in a less obvious way?</i></b>

10:08.420 --> 10:11.210
<b>There are plenty more rocks where those came from!</b>

10:11.210 --> 10:15.050
<b>If you don't stop me, they'll keep coming.</b>

10:15.050 --> 10:17.260
<b>So you think you'll be able to deal with my speed</b>

10:17.260 --> 10:20.510
<b>if you know which direction I'm coming from?</b>

10:20.850 --> 10:23.600
<b>How pathetic. But I'll play along.</b>

10:23.600 --> 10:25.020
<b><i>In fact,</i></b>

10:25.020 --> 10:26.480
<b><i>I'll take you...</i></b>

10:27.100 --> 10:27.980
<b><i>straight on!</i></b>

10:34.650 --> 10:36.650
<b><i>He's too fast. I can't see him.</i></b>

10:36.650 --> 10:38.530
<b><i>But it doesn't matter if I can't.</i></b>

10:38.530 --> 10:40.320
<b><i>Because of this!</i></b>

10:42.450 --> 10:44.200
<b>Gotcha!</b>

10:46.040 --> 10:49.420
<b>Think about how stupid you 
were to face off against me</b>

10:49.420 --> 10:51.040
<b>on your way down to Hell!</b>

10:55.340 --> 10:56.710
<b>It's over.</b>

10:56.710 --> 10:59.590
<b>Unfortunately, I couldn't go easy on them.</b>

11:00.380 --> 11:03.890
<b>Yes, Hammerhead's body is here too.</b>

11:03.890 --> 11:05.390
<b>I'll head back now—</b>

11:07.350 --> 11:09.190
<b><i>The body disappeared?</i></b>

11:13.310 --> 11:14.520
<b><i>That was close!</i></b>

11:14.520 --> 11:17.230
<b><i>Good thing he hit my head.</i></b>

11:17.230 --> 11:21.910
<b><i>My skull always was several times thicker than normal.</i></b>

11:21.910 --> 11:24.530
<b><i>Dammit. I don't know who that bastard was,</i></b>

11:24.530 --> 11:26.410
<b><i>but one day I'm gonna kill—</i></b>

11:26.410 --> 11:26.830
<b><i>Huh?</i></b>

11:27.290 --> 11:29.330
<b><i>Now what?</i></b>

11:34.960 --> 11:36.050
<b>Hm?</b>

11:37.590 --> 11:39.260
<b>Oh, there you are.</b>

11:52.310 --> 11:54.440
<b>As with the mosquito monster,</b>

11:54.440 --> 11:59.030
<b>I once again underestimated my opponent's power.</b>

11:59.360 --> 12:02.950
<b>I let my guard down and Kabuto took advantage of that.</b>

12:02.950 --> 12:06.370
<b>If Saitama-sensei had not been there,</b>

12:06.370 --> 12:09.410
<b>I would have certainly been destroyed.</b>

12:09.410 --> 12:10.410
<b>I see.</b>

12:10.790 --> 12:12.500
<b>Well, I'm glad you're okay—</b>

12:12.500 --> 12:13.750
<b>Doctor...</b>

12:13.750 --> 12:16.670
<b>Saitama-sensei saved my life twice.</b>

12:17.340 --> 12:20.170
<b>You, Doctor Kuseno, restored my life.</b>

12:20.170 --> 12:23.180
<b>Later this same life was saved by Saitama-sensei,</b>

12:23.180 --> 12:25.390
<b>who now has saved it again.</b>

12:26.100 --> 12:28.680
<b>Yes, I get the picture, Genos.</b>

12:29.350 --> 12:31.520
<b>What you're trying to tell me is</b>

12:31.520 --> 12:34.270
<b>that this Saitama-kun is amazing, right?</b>

12:34.270 --> 12:35.440
<b>Yes.</b>

12:35.850 --> 12:38.980
<b>Genos, they're not ready just yet,</b>

12:38.980 --> 12:41.440
<b>but I am developing a new series of augmentations.</b>

12:42.240 --> 12:44.860
<b>When I replace your existing parts with these new ones,</b>

12:44.860 --> 12:47.450
<b>you may be able to surpass this Saitama-kun.</b>

12:48.580 --> 12:51.370
<b>I imagine he must possess an enormous amount of strength</b>

12:51.370 --> 12:54.620
<b>for you to go on about him like this.</b>

12:56.380 --> 12:57.210
<b>Yes.</b>

12:58.090 --> 12:59.590
<b>What's your deal?</b>

12:59.590 --> 13:01.760
<b>You here to sign up with the Paradisers?</b>

13:01.760 --> 13:02.460
<b>No, no.</b>

13:03.130 --> 13:05.760
<b>I'm just a guy who's a hero for fun.</b>

13:06.050 --> 13:09.310
<b>I'm here to smash your heads 
in for personal reasons.</b>

13:10.140 --> 13:12.020
<b>So, where are your followers?</b>

13:12.020 --> 13:14.140
<b>Then, die!</b>

13:21.070 --> 13:23.740
<b>I better get out of here quick.</b>

13:26.410 --> 13:27.360
<b><i>Huh?!</i></b>

13:27.360 --> 13:29.120
<b><i>I thought I punched him?</i></b>

13:29.870 --> 13:31.580
<b>What a letdown.</b>

13:31.580 --> 13:34.870
<b>I was all excited about these battle suits.</b>

13:35.160 --> 13:36.920
<b>But the design is lame,</b>

13:36.920 --> 13:38.920
<b>and all they do is give you superhuman strength.</b>

13:42.420 --> 13:44.300
<b>You have no idea how hard it was</b>

13:44.300 --> 13:46.340
<b>to get ahold of these things!</b>

13:46.340 --> 13:50.600
<b>How could you know their value?!</b>

13:52.640 --> 13:58.520
<b>I've been looking for someone to test the full power of this suit on!</b>

14:06.240 --> 14:09.320
<b>Spin Attack!</b>

14:09.950 --> 14:14.080
<b><i>I used to use that move all the time when I was a kid...</i></b>

14:17.120 --> 14:18.040
<b>Huh?</b>

14:18.040 --> 14:19.580
<b>No way...</b>

14:21.380 --> 14:25.420
<b><i>Hammerhead, huh? He's a lot like me.</i></b>

14:25.760 --> 14:28.590
<b>What the hell are you?!</b>

14:37.640 --> 14:41.980
<b>W-Wait. I just wanted to get out of working...</b>

14:44.980 --> 14:46.820
<b>Don't be bad anymore, okay?</b>

14:46.820 --> 14:50.070
<b>Huh? So you're not going to kill me?</b>

14:50.070 --> 14:50.780
<b>Get outta here!</b>

14:50.780 --> 14:52.160
<b>Okay!</b>

15:00.670 --> 15:01.830
<b>Guess I'll go home.</b>

15:03.750 --> 15:06.670
<b>Where did Hammerhead go?</b>

15:08.720 --> 15:11.050
<b>There's no one left but you.</b>

15:19.810 --> 15:22.900
<b>Hammerhead went that way. Butt-naked.</b>

15:26.940 --> 15:28.070
<b>What's this?</b>

15:33.990 --> 15:35.530
<b>Hey, you got it wrong.</b>

15:37.040 --> 15:38.660
<b>I got what wrong?</b>

15:39.330 --> 15:41.920
<b>I'm not one of the Paradisers.</b>

15:42.920 --> 15:44.290
<b>You're lying.</b>

15:44.290 --> 15:47.710
<b>No, no, no. Don't be dumb—look at me!</b>

15:47.710 --> 15:48.920
<b>I don't need to.</b>

15:49.510 --> 15:52.630
<b>With that bald head, there's no denying it.</b>

15:52.630 --> 15:53.340
<b>No.</b>

15:53.640 --> 15:55.350
<b>Look! It's me. Me!</b>

15:55.350 --> 15:57.680
<b>You know, the guy who's a hero for fun—</b>

15:57.680 --> 15:58.430
<b>Never heard of you.</b>

16:03.400 --> 16:05.060
<b>Oh, I see...</b>

16:05.060 --> 16:08.030
<b>Either way, it doesn't matter.</b>

16:08.730 --> 16:13.780
<b>You read my attacks. Twice. That's the real problem.</b>

16:14.070 --> 16:16.030
<b>Born in a ninja village,</b>

16:16.030 --> 16:19.700
<b>I've been perfecting my techniques since childhood.</b>

16:20.700 --> 16:26.080
<b>Yet you saw right through them. This I cannot allow.</b>

16:26.920 --> 16:28.880
<b><i>What's he talking about?</i></b>

16:29.840 --> 16:32.220
<b>My pride won't have it.</b>

16:32.220 --> 16:36.640
<b>I don't care who you are, I can't let you simply walk away.</b>

16:37.300 --> 16:38.930
<b>Oh, come on.</b>

16:39.600 --> 16:42.680
<b>You just want to try out your moves on me.</b>

16:43.060 --> 16:45.560
<b>I can tell by that innocent smile of yours.</b>

16:54.110 --> 16:57.780
<b><i>What do you think of this speed that beats sound?</i></b>

16:57.780 --> 16:59.540
<b><i>Of these shock waves?</i></b>

17:00.200 --> 17:01.540
<b><i>Can you even see me?</i></b>

17:05.330 --> 17:08.040
<b><i>How can you possibly keep up with me?</i></b>

17:13.340 --> 17:14.760
<b>Can I go home?</b>

17:16.010 --> 17:17.140
<b><i>Bastard!</i></b>

17:17.470 --> 17:19.220
<b>Wind Blade Kick!</b>

17:22.980 --> 17:24.430
<b>Checkmate.</b>

17:28.400 --> 17:29.440
<b>Sorry!</b>

17:29.440 --> 17:31.730
<b>That wasn't on purpose.</b>

17:31.730 --> 17:33.280
<b>I meant to stop before hitting you,</b>

17:33.280 --> 17:35.400
<b>but your momentum carried my fist into your...</b>

17:38.160 --> 17:42.660
<b>We Are Experiencing Technical Difficulties.</b>

17:38.160 --> 17:42.660
<b>We Are Experiencing Technical Difficulties.</b>

17:38.160 --> 17:42.660
<b>Please Stand By.</b>

17:38.160 --> 17:42.660
<b>Please Stand By.</b>

17:43.080 --> 17:46.370
<b>I've worked every job from assassin to bodyguard.</b>

17:46.370 --> 17:48.170
<b>No ninja is more deadly.</b>

17:48.170 --> 17:49.670
<b>I am Speed-o'-Sound Sonic!</b>

17:49.920 --> 17:52.340
<b>But I'm putting my work on hold.</b>

17:52.340 --> 17:54.880
<b>Now that I've found such a formidable opponent,</b>

17:54.880 --> 17:57.930
<b>I will dedicate myself to training until we settle this.</b>

17:59.050 --> 18:01.310
<b>Let me know your name.</b>

18:01.310 --> 18:03.060
<b>It's Saitama.</b>

18:03.060 --> 18:04.390
<b>Saitama!</b>

18:04.390 --> 18:07.440
<b>Next time we meet, it'll be your demise!</b>

18:09.980 --> 18:10.860
<b>Okay.</b>

18:11.190 --> 18:14.190
<b>I, Speed-o'-Sound Sonic, the ultimate ninja,</b>

18:14.190 --> 18:16.450
<b>will bring you down without fail!</b>

18:17.150 --> 18:18.410
<b>Train hard!</b>

18:21.160 --> 18:23.080
<b>Speed-o'-Sound Sonic?</b>

18:23.080 --> 18:24.290
<b>Who is that?</b>

18:24.290 --> 18:27.160
<b>And who would possess such a redundant name?</b>

18:27.160 --> 18:28.500
<b>Dunno.</b>

18:28.500 --> 18:29.580
<b>He suddenly appeared,</b>

18:29.580 --> 18:31.880
<b>declared we were rivals, and took off.</b>

18:31.880 --> 18:34.590
<b>If he is a nuisance, I will get rid of him.</b>

18:34.590 --> 18:36.170
<b>Well, you're hardly different.</b>

18:36.170 --> 18:38.430
<b>Actually, why are you here again?</b>

18:38.430 --> 18:40.340
<b>Go home! It's not like we're related!</b>

18:40.340 --> 18:42.600
<b>Sensei, I must become stronger—</b>

18:42.600 --> 18:43.930
<b>Shut up!</b>

18:45.350 --> 18:50.190
<b>I'm now aware of a serious problem and am reeling from shock.</b>

18:50.190 --> 18:52.810
<b>So I beg you, go home for today.</b>

18:52.810 --> 18:54.570
<b>A serious problem?</b>

18:54.570 --> 18:58.490
<b>What could cause a problem

<b>No one knows who I am.</b>

<b>It's been three years since I first became a hero.</b>

19:15.960 --> 19:20.720
<b>I've defeated many monsters and

19:20.720 --> 19:25.180
<b>I've never heard of any other

19:25.180 --> 19:28.730
<b>Everyone in the world should know me by now!</b>

19:28.730 --> 19:32.100
<b>Isn't it weird that I don't have any fans or anything?!</b>

19:32.690 --> 19:35.480
<b>You know what he said to me today?</b>

19:35.480 --> 19:37.400
<b>"Never heard of you".</b>

19:37.400 --> 19:42.860
<b>Plus, everyone in town took me for a terrorist.</b>

19:42.860 --> 19:46.740
<b>They've all forgotten how I beat
