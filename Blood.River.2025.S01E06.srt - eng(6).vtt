[Blood River]

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:33.980
[Based on the novel of the same name from Zhou Munan's Youth in Jianghu series]

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:35.980
[Available on fanqienovel.com & bkneng.com]

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:38.980
[Episode 6]

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:05.180
He's Xie Ba's favorite disciple.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:06.690
Killing him

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:08.500
would be the same as declaring war on the Xie family.

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:11.340
Just tell them that I killed him.

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:12.610
There's nothing to be afraid of.

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:14.450
Xie Ba is declaring war

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:15.450
on the entire Su family.

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:17.980
I'm not afraid that he's declaring war on us.

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:19.850
I'm just worried that he'll be too timid to act.

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:21.730
I'm leaving.

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:22.170
Wait.

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:37.980
We must put on the full act.

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:40.100
Once a person crosses the Blood River,

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:41.820
they shall reach the shore.

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:43.450
Where the shore lies

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:45.060
will no longer be the dark of night.

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:47.380
It will be light.

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:51.610
Someone's coming.

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:52.500
Hurry and leave.

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:00.610
What a shame.

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:02.340
There aren't many interesting people

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:03.500
in the current Xie family.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:04.940
I guess you could be considered one.

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:07.980
I would've liked to engage you in a fiery battle

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:10.220
if you didn't have

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:11.220
such a sickly complexion.

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:16.260
This is truly unexpected.

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:18.130
The Undertaker of Blood River

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:19.890
is actually very melancholic.

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:21.570
It's you?

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:23.450
The family head of the Mu family,

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:24.780
Mu Zizhe.

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:26.630
[Mu Zizhe, Family Head of Mu family]

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:27.690
You killed Xie Fanhua.

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:30.410
Xie Ba won't let you off.

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:31.660
Even after that,

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:32.270
the members of Blood River

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:33.410
won't let each other off.

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:35.410
Perhaps the so-called Three Families

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:36.660
will only have one family left at the very end.

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:38.100
The sword has been unsheathed.

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:39.660
Why hide its luster?

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:41.610
You're the youngest family head

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:42.820
in the history of the Mu family.

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:44.820
Don't you wish to be

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:45.730
the youngest Patriarch

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:47.260
in all of history?

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:49.220
You're truly

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:51.170
interesting.

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:52.850
I'm here to kill you.

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:55.850
Actually, I already wanted to kill you

00:03:56.590 --> 00:03:58.010
when I met you for the first time.

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:17.930
Actually,

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:20.020
your so-called Uncle Zhe,

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:21.660
he's my father.

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:24.290
This is why

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:26.290
I've been inquiring about his whereabouts.

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:27.810
My mother

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:29.250
told me nothing.

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:30.610
She only told me

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:32.660
that he was Kui of Blood River.

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:34.930
That's impossible.

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:37.340
I'm not joking.

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:38.580
Why is it impossible?

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:40.900
The members of Blood River

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:43.020
never marry anyone outside of the sect.

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:44.900
Someone already broke the rule once

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:46.580
and married someone

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:47.410
outside of the sect.

00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:49.810
But in the end?

00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:51.290
He

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:53.730
and his family

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:55.100
were wiped out.

00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:57.370
Uncle Zhe was once Kui.

00:04:58.000 --> 00:04:59.100
Even now, he holds a high position

00:04:59.160 --> 00:04:59.780
in the Mu family.

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:02.340
It's impossible for him to have a child outside of the sect.

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:04.570
You see,

00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:05.980
I was just joking with you.

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:07.730
You actually gave me

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:08.700
an honest and rigid answer.

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:10.220
Isn't Blood River's Kui

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:12.020
the potential candidate to inherit the title of Patriarch?

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:13.220
If so,

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:14.730
why didn't the Patriarch pass the throne to you?

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:16.050
Wouldn't that resolve your crisis?

00:05:16.390 --> 00:05:17.410
I'm not a member

00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:18.100
of the Blood River's Three Families.

00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:20.220
I was born a Nameless.

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:21.580
There were no such individuals

00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:23.170
in Blood River

00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:25.140
who had inherited the title of Patriarch.

00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:26.900
The so-called Nameless

00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:28.220
were orphans.

00:05:28.390 --> 00:05:30.200
They were only granted a surname after they passed the trial.

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:31.810
They may have joined the Three Families in name,

00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:32.540
but in reality,

00:05:33.630 --> 00:05:34.400
they're not seen as

00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:35.340
true clan members.

00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:38.020
Back then, due to special circumstances,

00:05:38.750 --> 00:05:39.410
the Patriarch

00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:41.100
had no choice but to appoint me as Kui.

00:05:41.510 --> 00:05:42.220
All these years,

00:05:43.190 --> 00:05:44.580
I always wanted to hand over the position.

00:05:45.390 --> 00:05:46.020
But the Patriarch...

00:05:50.510 --> 00:05:51.730
The Patriarch didn't allow me to do so.

00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:54.540
I wanted to say this since just now.

00:05:54.920 --> 00:05:55.700
You're already wounded.

00:05:56.240 --> 00:05:57.730
Why are you pretending to be tough in front of me, the miracle physician?

00:05:58.270 --> 00:05:58.730
Sorry about that.

00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:01.140
I've expended most of my strength and qi

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:02.660
after the fierce battle.

00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:05.580
I was truly worried about

00:06:05.630 --> 00:06:06.490
the Patriarch.

00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:07.980
That's why I pretended to be tough.

00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:09.290
What about now?

00:06:10.510 --> 00:06:11.340
I can't hold it in anymore.

00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:24.780
Let me give you a diagnosis.

00:06:58.560 --> 00:06:59.340
The Life-Death Contract?

00:07:00.270 --> 00:07:01.460
Only the caster is able to neutralize it

00:07:01.480 --> 00:07:02.730
with their inner force.

00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:03.220
Miss Bai?

00:07:05.040 --> 00:07:06.250
I'll be fine after I treat my wound by regulating my qi.

00:07:06.720 --> 00:07:07.250
There's no need to worry.

00:07:07.480 --> 00:07:08.460
Regulate your qi to treat your wound?

00:07:08.870 --> 00:07:10.020
I think you're just trying to suppress the wound

00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:11.460
with your qi.

00:07:11.920 --> 00:07:12.540
Physicians like us

00:07:12.920 --> 00:07:13.930
hate stupid people like you

00:07:14.190 --> 00:07:15.140
who don't cherish their bodies

00:07:15.310 --> 00:07:16.460
and lives.

00:07:19.160 --> 00:07:19.850
I made a promise

00:07:20.480 --> 00:07:21.370
that I would protect the Patriarch.

00:07:22.750 --> 00:07:23.580
I also promised

00:07:24.240 --> 00:07:25.050
that I would protect you.

00:07:26.310 --> 00:07:27.410
Although I didn't promise

00:07:27.480 --> 00:07:28.410
that I would protect myself,

00:07:30.240 --> 00:07:31.660
I'll at least take care of myself

00:07:33.070 --> 00:07:33.930
until you two are doing well.

00:07:37.630 --> 00:07:39.140
Su Muyu, the logic expert.

00:07:40.240 --> 00:07:41.290
You should rest well.

00:07:43.800 --> 00:07:44.250
If not,

00:07:44.480 --> 00:07:45.170
you won't have any strength

00:07:45.240 --> 00:07:45.780
for the fight later.

00:07:46.510 --> 00:07:47.220
I'll be in trouble by then.

00:08:01.920 --> 00:08:02.660
This is truly interesting.

00:08:03.720 --> 00:08:05.020
The books that were kept in the secret chamber

00:08:05.070 --> 00:08:05.780
of Spider's Nest

00:08:06.630 --> 00:08:08.410
turned out to be nothing but miscellaneous tales

00:08:08.510 --> 00:08:09.540
and popular romances.

00:08:10.830 --> 00:08:11.980
Did they put them here because

00:08:12.070 --> 00:08:13.220
they were afraid that those who seek shelter here

00:08:13.600 --> 00:08:14.610
might be too bored?

00:08:34.630 --> 00:08:37.940
What a strange story.

00:08:41.720 --> 00:08:42.980
Miss Bai, let's move.

00:08:45.150 --> 00:08:45.700
Are you sure

00:08:45.750 --> 00:08:46.770
you've rested enough?

00:08:47.510 --> 00:08:48.420
Do all members of Blood River

00:08:48.720 --> 00:08:49.700
have no regard for their lives?

00:08:50.080 --> 00:08:50.940
In Blood River,

00:08:51.150 --> 00:08:52.490
I have a senior called Mu Zhaoyang.

00:08:53.150 --> 00:08:54.220
He created a set of techniques

00:08:54.270 --> 00:08:55.340
that were meant for resting.

00:08:55.910 --> 00:08:56.850
It's called the Resting Breath.

00:08:57.360 --> 00:08:57.940
The practitioners

00:08:58.000 --> 00:08:58.890
only sleep for two hours per day.

00:08:59.440 --> 00:09:00.130
After that, we'll find another chance

00:09:00.240 --> 00:09:01.060
to rest for a moment.

00:09:02.030 --> 00:09:02.850
That would be enough rest for us.

00:09:03.510 --> 00:09:03.980
To

00:09:04.030 --> 00:09:05.060
medical practitioners like us,

00:09:05.320 --> 00:09:06.220
it doesn't make sense at all.

00:09:06.960 --> 00:09:08.220
No matter how awesome the Resting Breath

00:09:08.390 --> 00:09:09.250
which was created by your senior is,

00:09:09.270 --> 00:09:10.060
it doesn't make sense

00:09:10.440 --> 00:09:11.220
from a medical perspective.

00:09:12.120 --> 00:09:12.650
Perhaps.

00:09:13.200 --> 00:09:13.990
But to us,

00:09:13.990 --> 00:09:14.700
it proves to be very useful.

00:09:15.390 --> 00:09:16.060
After all,

00:09:16.080 --> 00:09:17.060
we're always in a race against time.

00:09:18.240 --> 00:09:19.180
Sorry for the trouble.

00:09:20.750 --> 00:09:21.220
Let's go.

00:09:33.660 --> 00:09:36.180
[The Three Families are after Mu Mingce]

00:09:38.670 --> 00:09:41.130
The Three Families are in chaos now.

00:09:44.440 --> 00:09:46.060
Pitiful members of the Three Families.

00:09:46.670 --> 00:09:47.340
They think

00:09:47.360 --> 00:09:48.530
that they have a choice.

00:09:49.390 --> 00:09:50.610
But they never understood

00:09:51.200 --> 00:09:53.340
that the title of Patriarch is just a tool.

00:09:53.960 --> 00:09:55.420
The person wielding the tool

00:09:55.910 --> 00:09:57.700
has never been them.

00:09:57.870 --> 00:09:59.130
The Su family has Su Changhe

00:09:59.150 --> 00:10:00.530
and Su Muyu.

00:10:00.670 --> 00:10:01.490
There's no way to control them.

00:10:02.120 --> 00:10:03.650
Although the Xie family is powerful,

00:10:03.750 --> 00:10:05.730
they're reckless. They cannot win the hearts of the people.

00:10:06.600 --> 00:10:09.250
The Mu family is cunning and cruel.

00:10:09.510 --> 00:10:10.530
However, they're quite weak.

00:10:11.440 --> 00:10:13.060
We need a tool that will obey us.

00:10:13.720 --> 00:10:16.010
They can fight among themselves.

00:10:16.600 --> 00:10:18.890
We can take our time to find one.

00:10:19.540 --> 00:10:22.540
[I am incompetent. Please grant me The Death Coffin. — Mu]

00:10:24.960 --> 00:10:25.960
That Mu Zizhe

00:10:25.960 --> 00:10:27.690
is actually smart enough to ask for help.

00:10:29.870 --> 00:10:31.730
If so, we shall grant him The Death Coffin.

00:10:32.870 --> 00:10:34.060
It's time for us

00:10:34.670 --> 00:10:35.890
to head to the battlefield as well.

00:10:37.120 --> 00:10:39.820
Let's find out who the final victor is.

00:10:40.550 --> 00:10:42.490
Naturally, everyone except for you can go.

00:10:43.150 --> 00:10:44.420
This trip will dispel our misfortune

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:45.890
and absolve us of our sins.

00:10:46.720 --> 00:10:48.220
However, it cannot grant us any blessings.

00:10:48.840 --> 00:10:50.370
If so, I shall go.

00:10:51.200 --> 00:10:51.700
All right.

00:10:52.270 --> 00:10:53.100
You shall go.

00:10:53.960 --> 00:10:55.300
We've been holed up in here for so long.

00:10:55.960 --> 00:10:57.850
It's time for us to take a stroll outside.

00:11:11.360 --> 00:11:11.770
Miss Bai.

00:11:22.910 --> 00:11:23.850
Please wait here.

00:11:24.440 --> 00:11:25.610
I'll head out and inspect the area.

00:11:26.320 --> 00:11:26.730
All right.

00:11:50.390 --> 00:11:51.220
You're Mu Bai,

00:11:51.840 --> 00:11:52.460
young master of the Mu family.

00:11:53.030 --> 00:11:53.820
Su Muyu.

00:11:54.670 --> 00:11:56.370
I've been waiting for you.

00:11:59.320 --> 00:12:00.850
You're smarter than I thought.

00:12:02.120 --> 00:12:02.700
Did you forget?

00:12:03.550 --> 00:12:05.010
Every array in Spider's Nest

00:12:05.270 --> 00:12:07.010
was created by the Mu family.

00:12:07.510 --> 00:12:08.850
Although we cannot observe the entire area,

00:12:09.360 --> 00:12:10.530
there are some tracks

00:12:10.600 --> 00:12:11.370
that we can still go after.

00:12:12.670 --> 00:12:14.010
Xuewei relayed the news to me.

00:12:14.790 --> 00:12:15.490
She said you and the miracle physician

00:12:15.510 --> 00:12:17.060
entered the secret tunnel.

00:12:17.750 --> 00:12:19.250
If so, I just need to wait here

00:12:19.870 --> 00:12:20.770
and kill the miracle physician when she appears.

00:12:23.550 --> 00:12:25.250
By then, the Patriarch

00:12:25.720 --> 00:12:27.530
won't be able to survive.

00:12:28.240 --> 00:12:28.770
But you?

00:12:30.870 --> 00:12:32.580
You're dumber than I thought.

00:12:33.390 --> 00:12:34.130
What do you mean?

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:36.420
Since I'm the one appearing before you,

00:12:37.240 --> 00:12:38.180
what makes you guys think

00:12:40.320 --> 00:12:41.180
that you can defeat me?

00:12:54.870 --> 00:12:56.420
Su Muyu, please hang in there.

00:13:13.670 --> 00:13:15.060
So, the family head of the Mu family

00:13:15.320 --> 00:13:16.180
is only good at

00:13:16.240 --> 00:13:17.250
playing sissy tricks, huh?

00:13:17.720 --> 00:13:18.850
Dance of the Butterfly, Nine Drives!

00:13:29.550 --> 00:13:29.980
Oh no.

00:13:47.150 --> 00:13:48.300
I guess this is the full extent

00:13:48.670 --> 00:13:49.820
of Blood River's Undertaker, huh?

00:13:50.120 --> 00:13:50.890
I already told you

00:13:50.910 --> 00:13:52.100
that I hate fighting the Mu family the most.

00:13:52.840 --> 00:13:53.850
You guys aren't assassins at all.

00:13:54.200 --> 00:13:55.300
You guys are mere tricksters.

00:13:57.120 --> 00:13:58.300
Initially, I thought the task I assigned to Uncle Zhe

00:13:58.360 --> 00:13:59.250
was a difficult one.

00:13:59.550 --> 00:14:01.220
I thought coming to Spider's Nest was a mere formality.

00:14:01.720 --> 00:14:02.250
I guess

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:04.650
my calculations were wrong.

00:14:05.550 --> 00:14:07.130
I should've taken on his task instead.

00:14:07.720 --> 00:14:08.610
During close-quarter combat,

00:14:08.960 --> 00:14:10.130
even a top martial arts expert

00:14:10.150 --> 00:14:11.340
might commit mistakes.

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:13.010
Therefore, I won't allow you

00:14:13.510 --> 00:14:14.650
to come near me.

00:14:14.720 --> 00:14:15.580
You do like to talk, don't you?

00:14:26.750 --> 00:14:27.300
Did you forget?

00:14:28.030 --> 00:14:28.650
I have a friend

00:14:28.720 --> 00:14:30.010
who also excels at using Puppet Strings.

00:14:30.270 --> 00:14:31.100
His name is Su Muyu.

00:14:31.240 --> 00:14:32.820
You may be invincible outside of close-quarter combat,

00:14:33.120 --> 00:14:34.460
but that's what we're doing right now.

00:14:34.630 --> 00:14:35.980
If so, that means I have the upper hand.

00:14:49.840 --> 00:14:51.220
I can only confirm this after testing you.

00:14:51.600 --> 00:14:52.610
You don't have enough inner force

00:14:52.630 --> 00:14:54.420
to sustain the Eighteen-Sword Array.

00:14:55.240 --> 00:14:56.850
Right now, you can only wield one sword.

00:14:57.510 --> 00:14:58.890
And, you're seriously wounded.

00:14:59.480 --> 00:15:01.130
Do you think you can defeat me?

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:02.730
It seems

00:15:03.270 --> 00:15:04.850
I can't enjoy my battle with you today.

00:15:05.750 --> 00:15:07.490
I don't think you would dare to engage me

00:15:09.270 --> 00:15:10.700
had I not used the Eighteen-Sword Array before this.

00:15:13.960 --> 00:15:14.650
It's rare for you

00:15:14.670 --> 00:15:15.770
to say something like that.

00:15:16.360 --> 00:15:17.460
You were always aloof and nonchalant.

00:15:17.790 --> 00:15:18.940
You didn't show any emotions

00:15:18.960 --> 00:15:19.770
usually.

00:15:20.150 --> 00:15:21.530
It seems you're truly flustered.

00:15:22.550 --> 00:15:23.580
You're trying to provoke me

00:15:23.600 --> 00:15:24.490
with such a method.

00:15:24.790 --> 00:15:25.650
Even so,

00:15:27.120 --> 00:15:28.580
you're still no match for me.

00:15:29.320 --> 00:15:30.340
Back then, both of us were known as

00:15:30.340 --> 00:15:32.240
the youngest top martial experts in our families.

00:15:33.200 --> 00:15:34.010
But Mu Zizhe knows

00:15:34.750 --> 00:15:36.010
all of your techniques.

00:15:36.720 --> 00:15:37.610
However, the techniques I use

00:15:38.910 --> 00:15:40.220
are unknown,

00:15:40.240 --> 00:15:41.530
even to the family head of the Su family.

00:15:41.840 --> 00:15:42.580
Is that so?

00:15:48.840 --> 00:15:50.300
Have you seen my Trinity Array before?

00:15:51.440 --> 00:15:52.130
I spent a lot of years

00:15:52.150 --> 00:15:53.890
to create and improve this array.

00:15:54.320 --> 00:15:56.300
All of the techniques and moves are closely knitted.

00:15:56.720 --> 00:15:58.060
My foes won't even stand a chance.

00:15:58.910 --> 00:15:59.530
Su Muyu,

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:01.100
you'll lose all of that confidence of yours

00:16:01.120 --> 00:16:02.650
very soon.

00:16:17.200 --> 00:16:17.890
Stop wasting your energy.

00:16:18.550 --> 00:16:19.530
They've ingested the Painless Powder,

00:16:19.550 --> 00:16:21.250
which the Mu family had invented not long ago.

00:16:21.600 --> 00:16:22.180
They know no pain.

00:16:22.910 --> 00:16:24.250
They will only obey our commands.

00:16:45.030 --> 00:16:47.060
You shall be annihilated in an instant.

00:16:47.670 --> 00:16:48.530
An instant

00:16:49.270 --> 00:16:50.490
is an eternity for me.

00:16:53.750 --> 00:16:54.580
I coated the dagger with poison.

00:16:59.080 --> 00:17:00.300
You actually tried to poison

00:17:00.750 --> 00:17:01.890
a member of the Mu family?

00:17:02.670 --> 00:17:03.300
Naturally, you won't be harmed

00:17:03.360 --> 00:17:04.860
by such a weak poison.

00:17:05.310 --> 00:17:06.140
But you see...

00:17:12.790 --> 00:17:14.380
I won't treat any of you with respect

00:17:15.200 --> 00:17:15.810
unless

00:17:16.270 --> 00:17:17.420
Su Jinhui comes here personally.

00:17:17.830 --> 00:17:19.380
Even if what you said was true,

00:17:20.070 --> 00:17:20.870
you have to deal with

00:17:20.870 --> 00:17:21.660
the three of us at the same time.

00:17:22.200 --> 00:17:23.220
If so, you won't have enough time

00:17:23.270 --> 00:17:24.460
to expel the poison in your body.

00:17:24.920 --> 00:17:26.090
To you, the poison

00:17:26.440 --> 00:17:27.700
might not amount to anything at the moment.

00:17:27.880 --> 00:17:29.140
But what if the poison lasts for

00:17:29.270 --> 00:17:30.180
two hours?

00:17:33.350 --> 00:17:34.380
I'm afraid even a mighty person like you

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:36.290
requires the help of the miracle physician

00:17:36.310 --> 00:17:37.010
just to stay alive.

00:17:38.030 --> 00:17:38.810
Su Changhe,

00:17:39.750 --> 00:17:41.810
you've truly surprised me time and time again.

00:17:42.200 --> 00:17:43.980
Farewell, family head.

00:17:46.830 --> 00:17:47.330
How was it?

00:17:48.480 --> 00:17:49.490
I assume you two

00:17:49.510 --> 00:17:50.380
had witnessed my performance.

00:17:51.310 --> 00:17:53.140
I truly gave it my all

00:17:53.350 --> 00:17:54.290
this time around.

00:17:55.750 --> 00:17:57.090
I almost died, you know?

00:17:57.920 --> 00:17:59.770
Remember to flatter me

00:17:59.920 --> 00:18:01.380
in front of the family head, okay?

00:18:01.880 --> 00:18:03.290
With Cutting Embrace, your main offense weapon,

00:18:03.550 --> 00:18:05.180
Falling Autumn, your main defense weapon,

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:07.940
and White-Sleeve Sword, your main hidden weapon,

00:18:08.160 --> 00:18:09.490
your techniques are almost flawless.

00:18:09.960 --> 00:18:11.290
You do live up to your reputation as the Umbrella Ghost.

00:18:11.960 --> 00:18:12.770
You already saw through my sword arrays

00:18:12.830 --> 00:18:14.380
right after a few blows.

00:18:14.790 --> 00:18:15.770
But you forgot something.

00:18:16.110 --> 00:18:17.180
There's another me out there.

00:18:17.640 --> 00:18:18.530
I'm observing your every move

00:18:18.960 --> 00:18:20.770
outside the array.

00:18:21.270 --> 00:18:22.010
Those outside of the situation

00:18:22.400 --> 00:18:23.860
always see clearer.

00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:26.660
Mu Wusheng, target the Kan Gate in the southeast.

00:18:26.880 --> 00:18:28.380
Mu Wuheng, target the Xiu Gate in the north.

00:18:28.750 --> 00:18:30.460
Mu Wufeng, target his qi center.

00:19:21.350 --> 00:19:22.730
So what if you've invented the Trinity Array?

00:19:23.070 --> 00:19:24.180
Arrays are rigid

00:19:24.400 --> 00:19:25.770
while your foes aren't.

00:19:26.240 --> 00:19:27.530
No matter how meticulous an array is,

00:19:28.640 --> 00:19:29.940
there's always a way to dispel it.

00:19:30.350 --> 00:19:30.980
How did you find a way

00:19:31.030 --> 00:19:32.090
to dispel it

00:19:32.110 --> 00:19:33.180
in such a short period?

00:19:33.960 --> 00:19:34.490
I come from a place

00:19:34.510 --> 00:19:36.050
famed for its swordsmanship.

00:19:36.680 --> 00:19:37.220
Over there,

00:19:37.590 --> 00:19:38.380
there are people

00:19:38.400 --> 00:19:39.730
who study and invent swordsmanship.

00:19:40.310 --> 00:19:41.180
There are also some

00:19:41.240 --> 00:19:42.330
who focus on defeating the ways of the sword.

00:19:42.960 --> 00:19:44.180
My father once said this before.

00:19:45.510 --> 00:19:46.490
If one isn't the Sword Deity,

00:19:48.030 --> 00:19:48.940
one doesn't have the right

00:19:49.720 --> 00:19:50.730
to mention the word "sword"

00:19:50.830 --> 00:19:51.860
in front of him.

00:19:52.640 --> 00:19:53.570
The No-Sword City?

00:19:54.510 --> 00:19:56.380
You actually came from there?

00:19:56.830 --> 00:19:58.090
I didn't even use the Eighteen-Sword Array,

00:19:59.590 --> 00:20:00.380
and you've already lost to me.

00:20:01.400 --> 00:20:02.140
Did you think

00:20:02.750 --> 00:20:04.290
that I only brought three of them with me?

00:20:19.510 --> 00:20:20.220
The blossom side's up.

00:20:20.830 --> 00:20:21.530
Lucky.

00:20:21.960 --> 00:20:22.570
Qingyang.

00:20:23.030 --> 00:20:24.220
You're late.

00:20:24.720 --> 00:20:25.620
Sorry about that.

00:20:25.830 --> 00:20:26.620
I couldn't allow Xuewei

00:20:26.790 --> 00:20:27.860
to witness this battle.

00:20:28.030 --> 00:20:28.900
If not,

00:20:29.030 --> 00:20:29.620
she would definitely

00:20:29.640 --> 00:20:30.490
defend Su Muyu with her life.

00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:32.770
It took me a lot of effort

00:20:32.880 --> 00:20:34.010
to send her elsewhere.

00:20:36.350 --> 00:20:36.860
Lord Kui.

00:20:37.680 --> 00:20:38.420
We meet again.

00:20:39.110 --> 00:20:39.860
Qingyang.

00:20:40.960 --> 00:20:41.810
Five ghosts from the Mu family,

00:20:42.400 --> 00:20:43.380
Mu Bai,

00:20:43.510 --> 00:20:44.330
and Mu Qingyang, huh?

00:20:45.070 --> 00:20:45.700
It seems my only choice

00:20:45.880 --> 00:20:47.090
is to risk it all.

00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:48.660
Miss Bai,

00:20:49.270 --> 00:20:50.140
I hope this will help you

00:20:50.350 --> 00:20:51.700
to escape.

00:21:27.440 --> 00:21:28.140
Su Muyu.

00:21:28.750 --> 00:21:29.730
You won't be able

00:21:30.160 --> 00:21:31.770
to withstand this array for long.

00:21:35.610 --> 00:21:36.340
Darn it.

00:21:36.960 --> 00:21:38.250
That darned fool, Su Changhe.

00:21:38.790 --> 00:21:39.730
What a let-down.

00:21:41.070 --> 00:21:41.770
Uncle Zhe, you're here.

00:21:44.830 --> 00:21:45.620
That brat

00:21:46.030 --> 00:21:47.420
merely put on a show at Spider's Nest.

00:21:47.720 --> 00:21:48.770
He told me to keep guard over here.

00:21:49.680 --> 00:21:50.660
And, I did find my target.

00:21:51.350 --> 00:21:52.730
But the seven ghosts of the Mu family are here as well.

00:21:53.240 --> 00:21:54.900
Uncle Zhe, what do you mean by that?

00:21:55.440 --> 00:21:56.460
Did I say you could speak?

00:21:59.350 --> 00:21:59.960
You...

00:22:00.590 --> 00:22:01.730
Uncle Zhe, you still like

00:22:01.750 --> 00:22:03.490
to pretend as if you're someone powerful.

00:22:03.880 --> 00:22:04.860
Do I even need to do that?

00:22:05.200 --> 00:22:06.290
I'm powerful from the start.

00:22:06.920 --> 00:22:08.090
Uncle Zhe, what do you plan to do next?

00:22:08.750 --> 00:22:09.570
I plan

00:22:09.880 --> 00:22:10.810
to come up with a way

00:22:10.830 --> 00:22:12.420
to not kill you and complete my task at the same time.

00:22:14.070 --> 00:22:15.180
I'm afraid that would be quite difficult.

00:22:16.240 --> 00:22:17.010
Indeed.

00:22:19.440 --> 00:22:20.620
But you see,

00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:22.810
we've been through the muck together after all.

00:22:23.960 --> 00:22:25.330
You mean hardships.

00:22:26.590 --> 00:22:27.220
That's right.

00:22:28.510 --> 00:22:29.730
That's why we need to be educated.

00:22:31.590 --> 00:22:32.220
What about this?

00:22:32.750 --> 00:22:33.620
Let's join hands

00:22:34.160 --> 00:22:35.700
and deal with the ghosts for now.

00:22:36.200 --> 00:22:36.810
After that,

00:22:36.880 --> 00:22:37.660
we can settle

00:22:37.680 --> 00:22:38.330
our own family affairs.

00:22:46.160 --> 00:22:47.660
It seems at least one of them

00:22:47.920 --> 00:22:49.090
is quite powerful.

00:22:50.310 --> 00:22:51.220
Uncle Zhe, I've long heard of your name.

00:22:52.070 --> 00:22:52.900
Even if I'm not,

00:22:53.550 --> 00:22:54.460
I have to pretend to be powerful.

00:22:57.680 --> 00:22:58.810
That'll make things difficult for me, you know?

00:23:01.070 --> 00:23:01.570
What do you think?

00:23:02.160 --> 00:23:02.860
Uncle Zhe, I'm willing

00:23:03.510 --> 00:23:04.490
to fend off our foes together with you.

00:23:24.680 --> 00:23:25.380
Sorry about this.

00:23:26.030 --> 00:23:26.620
Muyu.

00:23:43.160 --> 00:23:43.810
Miracle physician,

00:23:44.240 --> 00:23:45.090
we meet again.

00:23:45.640 --> 00:23:46.620
I, Su Zhe of the Su family,

00:23:47.160 --> 00:23:48.090
am here to send the miracle physician to the afterlife

00:23:48.680 --> 00:23:50.010
under the family head's order.

00:23:59.400 --> 00:24:00.250
The Phantom Step, huh?

00:24:01.030 --> 00:24:01.660
You scum.

00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:05.090
Who exactly are you?

00:24:06.160 --> 00:24:06.660
Me?

00:24:07.790 --> 00:24:08.860
I'm Bai Hehuai,

00:24:09.310 --> 00:24:10.380
the miracle physician of the Medicine King Valley.

00:24:11.480 --> 00:24:12.700
Does your mother have the surname Wen?

00:24:15.030 --> 00:24:16.420
The Phantom Step that you used

00:24:17.030 --> 00:24:17.900
was the one I had modified.

00:24:18.750 --> 00:24:19.460
And,

00:24:19.480 --> 00:24:20.620
I only taught her the technique alone.

00:24:20.960 --> 00:24:21.420
You're right.

00:24:22.030 --> 00:24:22.770
So what?

00:24:24.830 --> 00:24:25.380
Su Zhe,

00:24:26.240 --> 00:24:27.070
what's the relationship

00:24:27.070 --> 00:24:28.180
between you and the miracle physician?

00:24:31.400 --> 00:24:32.090
That's none of your business.

00:24:32.790 --> 00:24:33.250
Fine.

00:24:33.790 --> 00:24:34.490
I'll stay out of it.

00:24:35.440 --> 00:24:35.860
Come.

00:24:36.640 --> 00:24:37.090
Do it!

00:24:38.030 --> 00:24:39.090
All of you, scram!

00:24:43.100 --> 00:24:43.920
Su Zhe,

00:24:43.960 --> 00:24:44.900
whose side are you on?

00:24:48.270 --> 00:24:49.290
Is your mother's name

00:24:49.830 --> 00:24:50.980
Wen Luojin?

00:24:51.400 --> 00:24:52.290
Is her nickname He?

00:24:53.400 --> 00:24:53.980
That's right.

00:24:55.350 --> 00:24:56.090
If so, you must be...

00:25:01.590 --> 00:25:02.720
I haven't had the chance

00:25:02.720 --> 00:25:03.730
to name you yet.

00:25:05.510 --> 00:25:06.620
So, your name is...

00:25:08.480 --> 00:25:09.810
Hehuai is the name my mother gave me.

00:25:10.640 --> 00:25:11.660
It means "White cranes fly south,

00:25:12.270 --> 00:25:13.250
gazing across the Huai River."

00:25:17.070 --> 00:25:18.420
White cranes fly south, huh?

00:25:22.960 --> 00:25:24.330
What an excellent name.

00:25:27.310 --> 00:25:28.980
Your mother is truly gifted

00:25:29.110 --> 00:25:30.140
when it comes to naming people.

00:25:31.550 --> 00:25:32.180
Do you mean like the time

00:25:32.920 --> 00:25:33.660
she called you Scum?

00:25:35.720 --> 00:25:36.220
That's right.

00:25:36.920 --> 00:25:37.660
Just like the time she called me Scum.

00:25:39.240 --> 00:25:40.700
So, what she said was true all along.

00:25:52.350 --> 00:25:53.180
Are you injured?

00:25:55.790 --> 00:25:56.290
Su Zhe,

00:25:56.880 --> 00:25:58.940
how dare you marry someone outside of our clan?

00:26:01.200 --> 00:26:01.770
So what if I did?

00:26:03.640 --> 00:26:04.730
You've broken the rules of our clan.

00:26:05.240 --> 00:26:06.140
Both you and this illegitimate child

00:26:06.480 --> 00:26:07.050
deserve to die!

00:26:08.480 --> 00:26:08.980
Nonsense.

00:26:09.680 --> 00:26:10.720
Blood River is trying

00:26:10.750 --> 00:26:11.860
to get rid of the Patriarch now.

00:26:12.310 --> 00:26:13.980
Now, you want to talk about the rules?

00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:16.010
I just married

00:26:16.030 --> 00:26:16.980
a beautiful woman outside of the clan

00:26:17.110 --> 00:26:18.250
and got myself a precious daughter.

00:26:18.550 --> 00:26:19.180
And now, you're saying

00:26:19.200 --> 00:26:20.220
that I broke the rules?

00:26:20.480 --> 00:26:20.980
What about you, then?

00:26:21.480 --> 00:26:22.490
You tried to kill the Patriarch.

00:26:23.070 --> 00:26:24.180
Executing you is too lenient

00:26:24.310 --> 00:26:24.900
of a punishment for you.

00:26:25.510 --> 00:26:25.900
You!

00:26:28.070 --> 00:26:28.530
Muyu.

00:26:29.400 --> 00:26:30.050
I never expected

00:26:30.070 --> 00:26:31.180
to encounter my daughter here.

00:26:31.440 --> 00:26:31.980
Do me a favor.

00:26:32.310 --> 00:26:33.620
I wish to speak with my daughter.

00:26:34.550 --> 00:26:35.420
I don't want any outsiders to bother us.

00:26:35.790 --> 00:26:36.290
Understood.

00:26:46.920 --> 00:26:48.900
This is truly a surprising reunion.

00:26:50.720 --> 00:26:51.770
If only

00:26:51.790 --> 00:26:52.860
your mother were here.

00:26:53.270 --> 00:26:54.250
What? Can't I be here instead of my mother?

00:26:54.790 --> 00:26:55.460
Of course you can.

00:26:56.200 --> 00:26:56.940
It's just

00:26:57.070 --> 00:26:58.380
that it would be better if my wife were here.

00:26:58.680 --> 00:26:59.380
No matter how good your wife was,

00:27:00.070 --> 00:27:00.490
you never

00:27:00.510 --> 00:27:01.330
returned home anyway.

00:27:02.790 --> 00:27:03.380
I didn't return home

00:27:03.400 --> 00:27:04.460
for the sake of you guys.

00:27:05.110 --> 00:27:06.420
I reviewed the Patriarch's memory.

00:27:07.200 --> 00:27:08.330
He gave you freedom.

00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:10.490
Yeah.

00:27:11.270 --> 00:27:12.700
He removed my position as Kui

00:27:13.400 --> 00:27:14.090
and granted me freedom.

00:27:15.440 --> 00:27:17.140
After that, I traveled to the Wen Residence happily.

00:27:17.790 --> 00:27:18.700
But your mother

00:27:19.160 --> 00:27:20.700
still contracted a terminal disease.

00:27:21.880 --> 00:27:22.620
Your grandfather

00:27:22.640 --> 00:27:23.490
kicked me out of the family.

00:27:24.030 --> 00:27:24.770
He said

00:27:25.240 --> 00:27:26.620
that he would kill me

00:27:26.790 --> 00:27:27.660
if I approached you

00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:28.810
or the Wen family.

00:27:29.160 --> 00:27:29.570
Of course,

00:27:29.920 --> 00:27:30.700
I wasn't afraid of him.

00:27:31.240 --> 00:27:32.330
But after I gave it some thought,

00:27:32.880 --> 00:27:34.180
I realized that I would only

00:27:34.880 --> 00:27:35.730
put you in danger

00:27:35.750 --> 00:27:36.730
if I stayed beside you.

00:27:39.680 --> 00:27:40.620
Scum.

00:27:41.790 --> 00:27:42.460
Good girl.

00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:44.420
Scum is what your mother used to call me.

00:27:44.680 --> 00:27:46.180
You have to call me your father somehow.

00:27:46.640 --> 00:27:47.090
Scummy Father.

00:27:47.960 --> 00:27:48.460
Fine, fine.

00:27:49.310 --> 00:27:50.010
I suppose that'll do.

00:27:50.480 --> 00:27:51.510
Will you still take my life?

00:27:52.550 --> 00:27:54.150
It was just a misunderstanding.

00:27:54.240 --> 00:27:54.570
And now,

00:27:54.880 --> 00:27:56.040
the misunderstanding has been resolved.

00:28:02.160 --> 00:28:02.980
Those who dare

00:28:03.020 --> 00:28:03.830
to approach my daughter

00:28:04.640 --> 00:28:05.530
will be killed immediately.

00:28:07.830 --> 00:28:08.330
Uncle Zhe.

00:28:08.960 --> 00:28:09.810
Don't you think your change of attitude

00:28:09.880 --> 00:28:10.660
is too immediate?

00:28:11.640 --> 00:28:12.770
Hey, we're a family.

00:28:13.110 --> 00:28:14.180
Stop being so courteous.

00:28:15.030 --> 00:28:15.460
Young Master,

00:28:16.160 --> 00:28:16.730
it appears

00:28:17.160 --> 00:28:17.940
that they're trying to join hands.

00:28:18.750 --> 00:28:19.900
Since the Su family wants a fight,

00:28:20.590 --> 00:28:21.620
we'll give it to them.

00:28:22.110 --> 00:28:22.620
How could we back off

00:28:22.680 --> 00:28:23.570
in front of them?

00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:24.700
Su Zhe

00:28:24.920 --> 00:28:26.420
was the strongest member of the Su family.

00:28:27.070 --> 00:28:28.220
Young fellow of the Mu family,

00:28:28.440 --> 00:28:29.530
you're wrong about something.

00:28:30.550 --> 00:28:31.090
What do you mean?

00:28:31.830 --> 00:28:32.660
I'm still

00:28:33.200 --> 00:28:34.490
the strongest member of the family.

00:28:48.920 --> 00:28:49.900
What kind of sinister technique is this?

00:28:50.480 --> 00:28:51.620
That's the Mu family's Hollow Ghost Array.

00:28:52.110 --> 00:28:52.570
Please be careful.

00:28:53.310 --> 00:28:54.330
How dare they use such a sinister technique

00:28:54.880 --> 00:28:56.330
when I have the Demon-Taming Staff?

00:28:56.400 --> 00:28:56.980
Such audacity.

00:29:17.920 --> 00:29:18.250
Let's go!

00:29:26.480 --> 00:29:27.290
I dispelled their array

00:29:27.720 --> 00:29:28.460
before they could set it up.

00:29:33.240 --> 00:29:33.700
Uncle Zhe,

00:29:34.200 --> 00:29:34.730
how come none of us

00:29:34.790 --> 00:29:35.810
noticed how powerful you were

00:29:36.480 --> 00:29:37.140
when we were dealing with

00:29:37.160 --> 00:29:37.900
the Demonic Sect back then?

00:29:39.830 --> 00:29:41.620
My daughter is here, you know?

00:29:41.790 --> 00:29:42.770
Of course I have to show off a little bit.

00:29:43.590 --> 00:29:44.660
It's not like I'm getting paid

00:29:44.960 --> 00:29:45.810
for dealing with the Demonic Sect.

00:29:46.030 --> 00:29:47.010
There's no need to go overboard.

00:29:48.030 --> 00:29:49.180
Uncle Zhe, you still went easy on them.

00:29:50.750 --> 00:29:51.620
Those two brats

00:29:51.960 --> 00:29:52.860
are quite capable.

00:29:53.200 --> 00:29:53.940
They managed to escape.

00:29:54.590 --> 00:29:55.620
So,

00:29:56.030 --> 00:29:57.290
since you two have been reunited,

00:29:57.720 --> 00:29:58.900
should I go somewhere else

00:29:59.550 --> 00:30:00.140
and give you two some time?

00:30:01.310 --> 00:30:02.250
No need for that.

00:30:02.680 --> 00:30:04.090
You can stand here.

00:30:04.750 --> 00:30:05.620
If not, it'll be very awkward.

00:30:08.160 --> 00:30:09.530
During such a critical moment,

00:30:09.830 --> 00:30:10.620
I reunited with my daughter,

00:30:10.960 --> 00:30:12.290
which was supposed to be a touching scene.

00:30:12.880 --> 00:30:13.660
But you see,

00:30:13.830 --> 00:30:14.900
I'm not very used to it.

00:30:16.110 --> 00:30:17.050
We can talk while we travel, then.

00:30:17.510 --> 00:30:18.180
We don't have much time left.

00:30:18.600 --> 00:30:19.840
We have to return to Spider's Nest as soon as possible.

00:30:20.590 --> 00:30:21.220
- All right. - All right.

00:30:32.750 --> 00:30:33.620
Su Zhe

00:30:34.110 --> 00:30:35.730
is too powerful to be true.

00:30:36.400 --> 00:30:37.050
He was once

00:30:37.790 --> 00:30:39.420
one step away from being

00:30:39.880 --> 00:30:41.250
the Patriarch after all.

00:30:41.720 --> 00:30:42.570
Once I return, I'll report this

00:30:42.590 --> 00:30:43.250
to Father immediately.

00:30:44.070 --> 00:30:44.570
This time,

00:30:45.920 --> 00:30:47.660
not only will we kill the Patriarch,

00:30:48.590 --> 00:30:49.660
but we'll also get rid of

00:30:50.200 --> 00:30:51.460
the Su family once and for all.

00:30:51.830 --> 00:30:52.620
That's right.

00:30:54.830 --> 00:30:55.860
You have a point.

00:30:57.880 --> 00:30:58.770
However,

00:30:59.720 --> 00:31:01.290
I think we still lack a convincing reason

00:31:01.960 --> 00:31:03.620
to steel the family head's resolve

00:31:04.550 --> 00:31:05.700
of dealing with

00:31:06.200 --> 00:31:07.530
the Su family.

00:31:08.240 --> 00:31:08.900
What do we need?

00:31:10.880 --> 00:31:11.810
Your death.

00:31:17.750 --> 00:31:18.460
Now,

00:31:19.160 --> 00:31:21.220
all of the traps here have been disarmed.

00:31:22.160 --> 00:31:24.250
Even the Spider Web, which was meant to ward off foes, was destroyed.

00:31:25.270 --> 00:31:26.490
Now, I can only depend on you all

00:31:26.920 --> 00:31:28.050
to defend the place.

00:31:34.640 --> 00:31:35.860
- Sir. - Sir.

00:31:36.480 --> 00:31:37.290
Good job, everyone.

00:31:41.550 --> 00:31:42.290
Su Zhe?

00:31:44.480 --> 00:31:44.860
Sir.

00:31:45.310 --> 00:31:45.730
Have you

00:31:45.830 --> 00:31:46.490
betrayed us?

00:31:48.070 --> 00:31:48.700
How could you guys

00:31:48.720 --> 00:31:49.490
have no confidence in me?

00:31:50.240 --> 00:31:51.490
Do you guys think I'll defect to our enemies' side

00:31:51.880 --> 00:31:52.980
while you guys are still keeping guard here?

00:31:56.830 --> 00:31:57.290
Sir,

00:31:57.720 --> 00:31:58.770
back then, joining the Spider's Nest

00:31:59.030 --> 00:32:00.000
was a top honor.

00:32:00.510 --> 00:32:01.050
But now,

00:32:01.550 --> 00:32:03.250
our own clan members are after us.

00:32:03.830 --> 00:32:05.730
It's as if we're sinners.

00:32:06.510 --> 00:32:07.290
They're the ones at fault here.

00:32:08.510 --> 00:32:09.090
It's not you guys.

00:32:11.440 --> 00:32:12.570
Uncle Zhe is here to aid us.

00:32:13.480 --> 00:32:14.380
As the previous Kui,

00:32:15.750 --> 00:32:16.900
he's willing to be on our side.

00:32:17.920 --> 00:32:18.810
Brat,

00:32:19.160 --> 00:32:20.330
stop slapping labels on me.

00:32:24.240 --> 00:32:25.220
However,

00:32:25.640 --> 00:32:26.980
quelling the internal dispute of Blood River

00:32:27.550 --> 00:32:28.810
is indeed a part of my duties.

00:32:29.880 --> 00:32:30.330
Sir,

00:32:31.070 --> 00:32:31.900
Miss Bai has already found a way

00:32:32.160 --> 00:32:33.570
to cure the Patriarch of his condition.

00:32:34.200 --> 00:32:35.140
If that's the case,

00:32:35.920 --> 00:32:37.420
please tell her to perform the treatment.

00:32:38.200 --> 00:32:38.730
However,

00:32:39.510 --> 00:32:40.290
I cannot perform

00:32:40.790 --> 00:32:41.330
the treatment.

00:32:42.720 --> 00:32:43.460
But why?

00:32:46.510 --> 00:32:47.250
If I perform it,

00:32:48.030 --> 00:32:48.810
I will die.

00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:52.530
That won't do.

00:32:54.440 --> 00:32:54.940
Miracle physician.

00:32:58.000 --> 00:32:58.570
Is your death

00:32:59.440 --> 00:33:00.770
the only condition?

00:33:01.510 --> 00:33:02.380
Or can other people

00:33:03.720 --> 00:33:05.290
die on your behalf?

00:33:23.350 --> 00:33:24.180
After your mother's passing,

00:33:24.960 --> 00:33:26.460
I visited the Wen family in secret a few times.

00:33:27.070 --> 00:33:28.010
I realized that you were missing.

00:33:28.920 --> 00:33:29.800
I never expected you

00:33:30.200 --> 00:33:31.330
to travel to the Medicine King Valley

00:33:31.330 --> 00:33:31.980
just to study medicine.

00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:34.180
So, you returned to our residence

00:33:34.200 --> 00:33:34.770
plenty of times.

00:33:36.440 --> 00:33:37.900
Have you never met Mother even once?

00:33:38.590 --> 00:33:39.010
That's not true.

00:33:40.400 --> 00:33:41.620
I was able to see her

00:33:42.270 --> 00:33:43.090
on the night before her passing.

00:33:43.720 --> 00:33:44.220
What?

00:33:46.440 --> 00:33:47.090
That night, your grandfather

00:33:47.110 --> 00:33:48.220
no longer obstructed me from seeing her.

00:33:49.160 --> 00:33:50.290
He brought me to her side.

00:33:53.750 --> 00:33:55.090
She died in my arms.

00:34:00.350 --> 00:34:01.220
You were still young back then.

00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:03.460
You were sleeping on the bed beside hers.

00:34:04.030 --> 00:34:04.620
You slept soundly.

00:34:05.270 --> 00:34:06.330
You slept until the next day.

00:34:08.190 --> 00:34:10.090
But according to my grandfather,

00:34:10.800 --> 00:34:12.740
you're a heartless person.

00:34:13.030 --> 00:34:14.690
You deceived my mother's feelings.

00:34:16.440 --> 00:34:17.820
That old fool...

00:34:21.030 --> 00:34:22.420
But according to my mother,

00:34:22.960 --> 00:34:23.980
you're not someone like that.

00:34:27.070 --> 00:34:27.740
That's why

00:34:29.070 --> 00:34:29.900
I wanted to find you

00:34:30.320 --> 00:34:31.170
and ask you about it personally.

00:34:33.320 --> 00:34:34.460
I was young back then.

00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:35.940
I thought love

00:34:36.030 --> 00:34:36.820
was above all else.

00:34:37.800 --> 00:34:38.610
With my capabilities,

00:34:39.150 --> 00:34:40.860
I was sure I could defy the rules of Blood River.

00:34:42.760 --> 00:34:43.640
Initially, I almost coerced them

00:34:43.640 --> 00:34:44.460
into agreeing with my conditions.

00:34:45.480 --> 00:34:46.690
But when they heard

00:34:47.030 --> 00:34:49.050
that the lady was the precious daughter of the Wen family,

00:34:49.670 --> 00:34:50.610
even the Patriarch

00:34:50.880 --> 00:34:51.820
was unwilling to help me out.

00:34:55.630 --> 00:34:56.740
In the end, I failed.

00:34:57.440 --> 00:34:58.010
Scummy Father,

00:34:58.960 --> 00:35:00.090
will you come with me?

00:35:01.960 --> 00:35:02.900
Of course.

00:35:03.510 --> 00:35:05.170
Wherever my daughter goes, I'll follow.

00:35:05.670 --> 00:35:07.490
If you say yes, I won't say no.

00:35:08.230 --> 00:35:09.690
But aren't you defying the rules of Blood River

00:35:09.690 --> 00:35:10.570
by doing so?

00:35:13.320 --> 00:35:14.980
The world is in chaos now.

00:35:15.400 --> 00:35:16.570
No one is going by the books.

00:35:17.360 --> 00:35:18.530
If so, it's every man for himself.

00:35:19.320 --> 00:35:19.690
All right.

00:35:20.360 --> 00:35:21.690
Come with me to the south

00:35:22.070 --> 00:35:23.260
once I'm done treating the Patriarch.

00:35:25.230 --> 00:35:26.210
Sure,

00:35:26.960 --> 00:35:27.610
but why?

00:35:28.840 --> 00:35:29.380
My girl,

00:35:29.800 --> 00:35:31.300
you're doing everything you can

00:35:31.440 --> 00:35:32.460
to treat the Patriarch.

00:35:33.550 --> 00:35:34.420
Are you doing it because

00:35:34.510 --> 00:35:35.490
you fell for Su Muyu?

00:35:40.510 --> 00:35:41.650
People say that Muyu

00:35:41.670 --> 00:35:42.740
is the best-looking member of Blood River

00:35:42.760 --> 00:35:43.780
in the past 100 years.

00:35:44.320 --> 00:35:45.780
It seems that wasn't just a rumor.

00:35:47.400 --> 00:35:48.010
However,

00:35:48.550 --> 00:35:49.740
it isn't a good thing for a girl

00:35:50.230 --> 00:35:51.420
to fall for a member of Blood River.

00:35:52.480 --> 00:35:53.570
Scummy Father,

00:35:54.190 --> 00:35:55.130
why are you insulting yourself as well?

00:35:57.190 --> 00:35:58.130
If not, why are you doing this, then?

00:35:59.440 --> 00:36:01.010
Of course it's because

00:36:01.710 --> 00:36:02.380
I get paid for it.

00:36:05.230 --> 00:36:06.570
Why did you take after your mother in that regard?

00:36:07.320 --> 00:36:08.690
Money is the most important thing, you know?

00:36:09.590 --> 00:36:10.050
However,

00:36:10.550 --> 00:36:11.260
we should only leave

00:36:11.320 --> 00:36:12.420
after the Patriarch has been cured.

00:36:13.280 --> 00:36:13.650
If not,

00:36:14.030 --> 00:36:14.860
all of my previous efforts

00:36:15.030 --> 00:36:16.090
will go down the drain.

00:36:17.590 --> 00:36:18.130
And,

00:36:18.800 --> 00:36:19.690
since Blood River

00:36:19.760 --> 00:36:20.860
is indebted to us,

00:36:21.150 --> 00:36:22.900
I think they won't stop us from leaving.

00:36:23.480 --> 00:36:24.050
I suppose they won't stop us

00:36:24.110 --> 00:36:24.780
from getting reunited.

00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:34.340
Sir,

00:36:34.880 --> 00:36:35.780
back then, joining Spider's Nest

00:36:36.150 --> 00:36:37.010
was a top honor.

00:36:37.590 --> 00:36:38.090
But now,

00:36:38.630 --> 00:36:40.480
our own clan members are after us.

00:36:40.920 --> 00:36:42.740
It's as if we're sinners.

00:36:45.230 --> 00:36:46.170
Were my principles

00:36:46.920 --> 00:36:48.210
the reasons why

00:36:48.840 --> 00:36:50.610
my followers became wandering vagabonds

00:36:51.190 --> 00:36:52.000
without anyone to depend on

00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:53.300
in Blood River?

00:36:57.960 --> 00:36:58.460
Lord Kui.

00:36:59.710 --> 00:37:00.170
Si the Snake.

00:37:01.190 --> 00:37:02.460
Lord Kui, sorry for interrupting your personal time.

00:37:02.960 --> 00:37:04.400
Miss Bai and Uncle Zhe were having a discussion.

00:37:04.710 --> 00:37:05.860
They wanted me to deliver the medicine to you.

00:37:11.800 --> 00:37:12.420
Si the Snake,

00:37:13.760 --> 00:37:14.650
don't leave yet.

00:37:17.670 --> 00:37:19.050
Lord Kui, do you have any other instructions?

00:37:21.030 --> 00:37:22.260
I suppose you were the newest member

00:37:23.510 --> 00:37:24.490
to join

00:37:24.590 --> 00:37:25.300
Spider's Nest, right?

00:37:30.760 --> 00:37:31.780
The previous Si the Snake

00:37:31.960 --> 00:37:33.380
died from a sudden illness a year ago.

00:37:34.440 --> 00:37:35.940
Lord Kui, you chose me

00:37:35.960 --> 00:37:36.690
among the other members.

00:37:38.360 --> 00:37:38.860
That's right.

00:37:40.710 --> 00:37:41.980
You wouldn't be roped into this conflict

00:37:43.190 --> 00:37:44.420
had I not chosen you

00:37:44.480 --> 00:37:45.460
back then.

00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:48.940
You were implicated because of me.

00:37:53.480 --> 00:37:54.010
Lord Kui,

00:37:55.280 --> 00:37:56.460
may I ask you a question?

00:37:58.630 --> 00:37:59.090
Go ahead.

00:38:00.110 --> 00:38:00.980
Is Blood River

00:38:01.880 --> 00:38:02.610
an organization filled with crooks?

00:38:10.440 --> 00:38:12.340
We kill for money, and we don't ask questions.

00:38:13.070 --> 00:38:14.380
People turn pale

00:38:14.480 --> 00:38:15.340
when they hear our name.

00:38:16.280 --> 00:38:17.210
We've accumulated countless feuds and grudges

00:38:17.630 --> 00:38:18.940
in the martial world and the imperial court.

00:38:19.670 --> 00:38:20.450
And, plenty of people

00:38:20.450 --> 00:38:21.930
want to get rid of us.

00:38:23.590 --> 00:38:24.690
So, are we crooks?

00:38:26.030 --> 00:38:27.210
Of course we are.

00:38:32.670 --> 00:38:34.650
But no one is born a willing crook.

00:38:37.150 --> 00:38:38.570
I was born in Blood River's Mu family.

00:38:39.590 --> 00:38:40.690
I've been learning how to kill people

00:38:40.760 --> 00:38:42.210
ever since I could remember things.

00:38:43.150 --> 00:38:44.340
We had no other choice

00:38:45.360 --> 00:38:46.980
ever since we were born.

00:38:49.030 --> 00:38:50.210
I thought joining Spider's Nest

00:38:50.920 --> 00:38:52.570
was just an extension of this nightmare.

00:38:53.670 --> 00:38:54.860
That was until I met you, Lord Kui.

00:38:56.320 --> 00:38:58.050
You were the first person I met in Blood River

00:38:58.760 --> 00:38:59.980
who harbored kind thoughts

00:39:00.360 --> 00:39:01.900
and retained hope in your heart.

00:39:03.230 --> 00:39:04.460
You were the one who told us

00:39:04.960 --> 00:39:05.860
that joining Spider's Nest

00:39:06.550 --> 00:39:08.090
could turn us into a protective shield

00:39:08.550 --> 00:39:09.780
from a killing tool.

00:39:11.070 --> 00:39:12.010
If so, I'm willing to die

00:39:12.840 --> 00:39:14.210
for the sake of protecting others.

00:39:16.190 --> 00:39:16.860
Thank you.

00:39:17.880 --> 00:39:19.420
But Lord Kui, you're the one I wish to protect,

00:39:19.960 --> 00:39:20.860
not the Patriarch.

00:39:25.230 --> 00:39:26.650
I think it's the same for Chen the Dragon and the rest.

00:39:27.840 --> 00:39:29.490
No one is born a willing crook.

00:39:31.110 --> 00:39:32.650
Even if one does turn into a crook,

00:39:33.880 --> 00:39:36.090
in our hearts, we still admire and long for

00:39:36.480 --> 00:39:37.900
kind individuals.

00:39:39.670 --> 00:39:40.260
Lord Kui,

00:39:41.960 --> 00:39:42.690
if Blood River

00:39:42.710 --> 00:39:44.050
represents the endless night,

00:39:45.230 --> 00:39:46.820
you're the first ray of light

00:39:48.280 --> 00:39:49.300
that I've encountered.

00:39:53.000 --> 00:39:53.740
Lord Kui,

00:39:54.590 --> 00:39:55.980
if the Patriarch dies,

00:39:58.320 --> 00:39:59.530
please wield the Dormant Dragon Sword

00:39:59.880 --> 00:40:01.090
and inherit the title of Patriarch.

00:40:10.880 --> 00:40:13.340
Lord Kui, please wield the Dormant Dragon Sword

00:40:13.510 --> 00:40:15.380
and inherit the title of Patriarch.
