[Episode 1]

The martial world of Beili is vast and turbulent.

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:43.900
Xueyue City in the south,

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:45.260
Wushuang City in the east,

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:48.050
and the Tang Clan, together with other prestigious sects,

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:50.820
built the brilliance and order of the martial world.

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:52.490
But beneath the brilliance,

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:53.820
there must be shadows.

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.980
Blood River,

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:58.020
the most mysterious assassin organization.

00:01:58.480 --> 00:01:59.620
Once you join Blood River,

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:02.620
you live only as someone's blade.

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:06.540
Still, there are those who seek light in the dark,

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:09.730
hoping to reach the shore amid raging currents.

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:11.260
The tide of Blood River

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:12.820
begins

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:15.220
to surge once more.

[Su Muyu, Blood River]

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:39.130
Why

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:54.450

[Second Master Tang, Tang Clan]

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:45.610
The snow comes too late for spring,

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:50.290
and turns into flying petals on the courtyard trees.

00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:00.340
I thought the winter

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:02.220
had ended.

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:05.450
People our age

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:08.260
are always impatient

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:11.130
for winter to pass.

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:13.220
But somehow, just as it ended,

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:14.570
it snowed again.

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:18.610
Blood River,

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:21.660
the world's best assassin organization.

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:23.370
They kill ministers and nobles

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:25.140
in the imperial court,

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:26.810
or wipe out entire sects

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:29.340
in the martial world.

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:32.810
Right or wrong, good or evil.

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:35.250
It means nothing to them.

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:38.050
You've led such an organization

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:39.250
for thirty years.

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:41.250
You must be tired.

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:43.730

the blood inside me

00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:51.580
would've long gone cold.

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:53.660
Thirty years ago,

00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:55.370
we had a duel,

00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:56.610
but there was no winner.

00:04:57.190 --> 00:04:57.980
As per our pact,

00:04:58.390 --> 00:05:00.490
I returned to lead the Blood River,

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:02.980
and you assisted Grand Master Tang

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:04.250
in rebuilding the Tang Clan.

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:06.100
Thirty years later,

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:08.220
we meet again to continue the duel.

00:05:08.390 --> 00:05:08.810
Yes.

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:12.370
I've lived in seclusion in Liaoluo City for years.

00:05:13.950 --> 00:05:16.100
It's time to stretch my body.

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:18.930
I've been waiting for this day.

00:06:08.430 --> 00:06:09.610
I was too arrogant when I was young.

00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:11.460
I tried to catch one of your hidden weapons with my bare hands

00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:12.900
and nearly died from the poison.

00:06:13.310 --> 00:06:15.050
I won't fall for that again.

00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:17.580
You may be able to catch a few of them,

00:06:18.270 --> 00:06:19.340
but what about

00:06:22.870 --> 00:06:24.050
How will you deal with that?

00:06:39.270 --> 00:06:42.100
What a brilliant move.

00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:44.170
It's been a long time

00:06:44.190 --> 00:06:45.580
since I've had such a great fight.

00:07:19.310 --> 00:07:21.140
The duel

we promised thirty years ago

00:07:22.480 --> 00:07:23.980
is for victory,

00:07:24.750 --> 00:07:26.170
not for life.

00:07:26.800 --> 00:07:28.250
To an assassin,

00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:30.100
there's no victory or defeat,

00:07:30.750 --> 00:07:32.220
only life or death.

00:07:35.630 --> 00:07:37.020
What a shame.

Shame?

00:07:40.600 --> 00:07:41.370
What a shame

00:07:42.390 --> 00:07:44.580
that your swift slash just now

00:07:45.510 --> 00:07:47.900
drained most of your zhenqi.

00:07:48.750 --> 00:07:49.700
And what a shame

00:07:50.240 --> 00:07:52.340
that you thought you were the one in control.

00:07:53.120 --> 00:07:54.140
Little did you know,

00:07:55.070 --> 00:07:58.100
you were also a pawn in someone else's game.

00:08:07.950 --> 00:08:08.580
Muyu,

00:08:09.120 --> 00:08:09.980

But this miracle physician

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:34.340
doesn't seem to welcome us.

00:12:35.550 --> 00:12:37.220
Perhaps King of Medicine's martial senior

00:12:37.240 --> 00:12:38.060
is old,

00:12:38.360 --> 00:12:39.100
and his hearing has gone.

00:12:39.550 --> 00:12:41.130
Knock harder.

00:12:45.390 --> 00:12:46.010
Uncle Zhe,

00:12:46.510 --> 00:12:47.490
are you knocking?

00:12:47.960 --> 00:12:49.220
You looked more like trying to kill him.

00:12:50.550 --> 00:12:52.130
Aren't we here to kill him?

00:12:59.670 --> 00:13:00.460
Who's that?

00:13:00.720 --> 00:13:02.060
Making such noise.

00:13:02.240 --> 00:13:03.010
My ears will go deaf.

00:13:03.550 --> 00:13:03.940
Young lady,

00:13:04.910 --> 00:13:06.180
may I ask if your master

00:13:06.510 --> 00:13:07.420
is at home?

00:13:07.910 --> 00:13:08.730
My master

00:13:08.840 --> 00:13:09.940
has gone out to see patients.

00:13:10.240 --> 00:13:10.820
How about this?

00:13:11.030 --> 00:13:12.180
I'll look for him.

00:13:12.720 --> 00:13:13.890
That would be a great help, young lady.

00:13:27.750 --> 00:13:28.460
What did you do?

00:13:30.670 --> 00:13:32.250
Oh, my apologies. My hand slipped.

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:35.370
Here.

00:13:35.390 --> 00:13:37.370
This is Scented Ointment.

00:13:38.200 --> 00:13:39.650
Rub it on your face,

00:13:39.870 --> 00:13:40.820
and in less than one hour,

00:13:41.120 --> 00:13:41.980
that red mark

00:13:42.150 --> 00:13:43.180
will disappear.

00:13:44.120 --> 00:13:45.010
Ridiculous.

00:13:53.320 --> 00:13:55.530
The Scented Ointment that can be tracked by medicine snakes.

00:13:56.200 --> 00:13:57.730
He thinks such tricks will fool me?

00:14:10.200 --> 00:14:10.730
Young lady,

00:14:11.480 --> 00:14:12.100
are you a physician?

00:14:13.510 --> 00:14:13.940
Why?

00:14:14.390 --> 00:14:15.650
Do I not look like one?

00:14:16.240 --> 00:14:16.580
I'm sorry.

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:17.530
I didn't mean to offend you.

00:14:18.720 --> 00:14:19.300
Mister,

00:14:19.750 --> 00:14:20.530
are you asking for directions?

00:14:21.240 --> 00:14:21.770
You have keen eyes, young lady.

00:14:22.360 --> 00:14:23.010
May I ask

00:14:23.600 --> 00:14:24.890
if there's a medicine hall nearby

00:14:25.240 --> 00:14:26.010
called Baihe?

00:14:28.120 --> 00:14:29.340
Are you here to see a physician?

00:14:29.750 --> 00:14:30.490
I'm quite skilled myself.

00:14:31.080 --> 00:14:31.850
You can ask for my help.

00:14:32.390 --> 00:14:33.580
Someone in my family is seriously ill,

00:14:34.030 --> 00:14:34.700
and he specifically asked for

00:14:34.720 --> 00:14:35.890
the miracle physician of Baihe Medicine Hall.

00:14:36.630 --> 00:14:37.530
Anyway, thank you for your kindness.

00:14:39.440 --> 00:14:40.370
How do you know

00:14:41.270 --> 00:14:42.370
I'm not

00:14:42.390 --> 00:14:43.010
from Baihe Medicine Hall?

00:14:43.870 --> 00:14:44.980
Could it be that you are...

00:14:45.480 --> 00:14:46.300
Of course I am.

00:14:47.750 --> 00:14:48.490
Young lady, please

00:14:48.630 --> 00:14:50.010
take me to your master.

00:14:50.870 --> 00:14:51.580
My master?

00:14:54.440 --> 00:14:55.700
He can't come here right now,

00:14:56.480 --> 00:14:57.580
but he told me

00:14:58.120 --> 00:14:59.220
a guest was coming

00:15:00.030 --> 00:15:01.980
from very far away.

00:15:02.550 --> 00:15:03.890
It must be you, I suppose.

00:15:05.870 --> 00:15:07.820
He asked me to go with you first.

00:15:09.670 --> 00:15:10.180
I hope you don't mind.

00:15:10.750 --> 00:15:11.580
I'm in a rush,

00:15:11.870 --> 00:15:12.770
so please mount up.

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:26.490
We've arrived.

00:15:36.870 --> 00:15:37.250
Sir.

00:15:38.360 --> 00:15:39.820
You've come just in time, sir.

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:40.650
Something's wrong

00:15:40.790 --> 00:15:41.700
with the Patriarch.

00:15:42.510 --> 00:15:43.010
Where's the miracle physician?

00:15:44.200 --> 00:15:44.940
I'm standing

00:15:44.960 --> 00:15:45.730
right in front of you.

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:46.890
How can you not see me?

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:49.180
Is she the miracle physician?

00:15:49.440 --> 00:15:49.820
No.

00:15:50.390 --> 00:15:51.010
Fine, I'll leave.

00:15:51.240 --> 00:15:51.890
Please don't be offended.

00:15:53.630 --> 00:15:54.370
She's the miracle physician's disciple.

00:15:55.120 --> 00:15:55.980
She came on her master's behalf

00:15:56.270 --> 00:15:57.340
to check the Patriarch's condition.

00:15:58.000 --> 00:15:58.850
Please come with me.

00:16:28.360 --> 00:16:29.060
I feel

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:32.100
there's a ghost inside.

00:16:37.120 --> 00:16:37.850
Don't be afraid, young lady.

00:16:57.030 --> 00:16:57.530
Sir.

00:17:06.960 --> 00:17:08.490
The last time I saw you,

00:17:09.350 --> 00:17:09.940
you were just

00:17:09.960 --> 00:17:11.700
a dirty kid with snot hanging.

00:17:12.960 --> 00:17:14.660
The last time I saw you,

00:17:14.960 --> 00:17:15.460
you were

00:17:15.720 --> 00:17:16.530
a god of killing

00:17:16.640 --> 00:17:18.010
who was ready to draw your blade at any time.

00:17:18.240 --> 00:17:20.620
I'm still ready to draw my blade anytime.

00:17:21.160 --> 00:17:22.620
Only my hair has turned white.

00:17:23.200 --> 00:17:24.180
My hands

00:17:25.160 --> 00:17:27.090
are still stained crimson.

00:17:27.960 --> 00:17:28.490
Enough talking.

00:17:31.920 --> 00:17:32.660
Let me read your pulse

00:17:33.030 --> 00:17:34.660
to see if you

00:17:34.920 --> 00:17:36.140
can still draw your sword.

00:17:53.270 --> 00:17:54.290
Put away your killing aura.

00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:56.490
If you scare me

00:17:56.830 --> 00:17:58.220
and my hand trembles,

00:17:58.750 --> 00:17:59.730
your Patriarch

00:17:59.880 --> 00:18:00.620
will be done for.

00:18:14.200 --> 00:18:15.140
Snow Falls on a Plum Blossom?

00:18:16.240 --> 00:18:16.770
That's right.

00:18:17.240 --> 00:18:19.380
How are you still alive?

00:18:23.550 --> 00:18:24.420
My Kui

00:18:24.550 --> 00:18:26.050
took the blow for me.

00:18:26.310 --> 00:18:28.330
Only half a plum hit me.

00:18:28.510 --> 00:18:29.900
I'm barely holding on.

00:18:31.030 --> 00:18:33.180
That's the Second Master Tang's

00:18:33.270 --> 00:18:34.490
signature poison.

00:18:34.960 --> 00:18:36.460
It's said to be the top poison of the Tang Clan,

00:18:36.880 --> 00:18:37.660
ranked second in the world,

00:18:38.310 --> 00:18:39.530
second only to the poison created by the Wen family head,

00:18:39.680 --> 00:18:40.810
Illusion.

00:18:41.240 --> 00:18:41.730
They say

00:18:42.110 --> 00:18:43.460
no one but Second Master Tang himself

00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:44.700
can cure it.

00:18:46.440 --> 00:18:47.330
Where's Second Master Tang?

00:18:48.310 --> 00:18:50.220
I killed him.

00:18:53.880 --> 00:18:55.220
I didn't know the Patriarch of Blood River

00:18:55.720 --> 00:18:57.330
would take a killing mission himself.

00:18:57.790 --> 00:18:58.490
Young lady,

00:18:59.400 --> 00:19:00.140
can you cure it?

00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:02.530
There's a saying in Medicine King Valley.

00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:04.860
"As long as one's not dead, they can be saved."

00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:07.050
However...

00:19:09.160 --> 00:19:10.140
Tell me what you need.

00:19:10.880 --> 00:19:11.660
Speak plainly.

00:19:13.590 --> 00:19:14.620
That's what I wanted to hear.

00:19:15.590 --> 00:19:15.980
Of course,

00:19:16.310 --> 00:19:17.180
I can heal him.

00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:18.530
As long as...

00:19:19.350 --> 00:19:19.980
As long as?

00:19:20.440 --> 00:19:21.380
...you can pay well.

00:19:40.510 --> 00:19:41.290
Looks like

00:19:41.310 --> 00:19:42.530
she's seen through your trick.

00:19:43.070 --> 00:19:44.250
She threw the bottle away

00:19:44.680 --> 00:19:45.730
as soon as she left the manor.

00:19:46.680 --> 00:19:48.010
Seems we were wrong.

00:19:49.270 --> 00:19:49.860
Wrong about what?

00:19:50.720 --> 00:19:52.730
We let the real miracle physician slip away.

00:19:53.310 --> 00:19:53.810
Fortunately,

00:19:54.720 --> 00:19:55.730
I made some preparations.

00:20:05.830 --> 00:20:06.380
Alright.

00:20:07.350 --> 00:20:08.620
Find me a place to stay.

00:20:08.830 --> 00:20:10.490
It's too much trouble running back and forth.

00:20:10.790 --> 00:20:12.140
Aren't you sending your master over?

00:20:12.480 --> 00:20:13.050
My master?

00:20:13.750 --> 00:20:14.940
He passed away a long time ago.

00:20:15.400 --> 00:20:16.730
Why do you all keep trying to make him

00:20:16.960 --> 00:20:18.420
crawl out from the grave?

00:20:18.750 --> 00:20:19.250
What?

00:20:21.030 --> 00:20:22.700
The King of Medicine's martial senior is dead?

00:20:24.750 --> 00:20:25.490
Muyu,

00:20:25.920 --> 00:20:26.940
you're mistaken.

00:20:27.680 --> 00:20:28.770
The person before you

00:20:29.030 --> 00:20:30.620
is the martial senior

00:20:30.640 --> 00:20:31.330
of the King of Medicine.

00:20:31.790 --> 00:20:33.860
The last disciple of Li Yuzhen,

00:20:34.240 --> 00:20:35.940
the founder of Medicine King Valley,

00:20:36.440 --> 00:20:37.660
Bai Hehuai.

00:20:38.790 --> 00:20:39.940
[Bai Hehuai, Medicine King Valley]
I'm Bai Hehuai, a physician.

00:20:40.240 --> 00:20:41.330
Greetings, sir.

00:20:44.750 --> 00:20:46.980
Greetings, Lord Kui.

00:20:51.550 --> 00:20:53.530
Lord Kui, I'm peckish.

00:20:55.750 --> 00:20:56.330
Forgive me, Miss Bai.

00:20:57.400 --> 00:20:58.290
We're in the wilderness.

00:20:58.750 --> 00:20:59.980
It's hard to find good food.

00:21:00.790 --> 00:21:01.380
This is all we have.

00:21:01.920 --> 00:21:02.420
That's all right.

00:21:02.720 --> 00:21:03.570
Having something to eat is good enough.

00:21:03.960 --> 00:21:04.460
Better than

00:21:04.590 --> 00:21:05.140
having to eat

00:21:05.200 --> 00:21:06.490
my martial senior's herbal cooking in the Medicine King Valley.

00:21:08.310 --> 00:21:09.900
You must be wondering

00:21:10.270 --> 00:21:11.730
how I know your identity.

00:21:12.480 --> 00:21:14.180
Since you and the Patriarch are old acquaintances,

00:21:15.350 --> 00:21:16.700
you must've heard of us.

00:21:17.270 --> 00:21:18.090
When I was little,

00:21:18.680 --> 00:21:20.290
my master used to tell me stories

00:21:20.920 --> 00:21:21.810
to make me study medicine.

00:21:22.510 --> 00:21:23.420
In his stories,

00:21:23.920 --> 00:21:24.570
there was often

00:21:24.680 --> 00:21:25.860
an organization called Blood River.

00:21:26.720 --> 00:21:28.700
It's formed by Su, Xie, and Mu,

00:21:29.160 --> 00:21:30.220
the Three Families.

00:21:30.750 --> 00:21:31.620
Their leader

00:21:32.200 --> 00:21:33.140
is known as the Patriarch.

00:21:33.790 --> 00:21:34.730
Under him

00:21:35.070 --> 00:21:36.420
is a direct assassin unit called Spider Shadow.

00:21:37.750 --> 00:21:38.670
[Rat, Snake, Ox, Rabbit, Dog, Tiger]
The strongest twelve

00:21:38.700 --> 00:21:39.000
[Horse, Dragon, Pig, Sheep, Chicken]
take the Earthly Branches

00:21:39.550 --> 00:21:41.050
as their code names,

00:21:41.790 --> 00:21:42.860
and their commander

00:21:43.270 --> 00:21:43.900
is Kui.

00:21:44.830 --> 00:21:46.380
The people I saw today

00:21:47.070 --> 00:21:48.380
all wore animal masks,

00:21:49.070 --> 00:21:49.660
but you alone

00:21:50.200 --> 00:21:51.660
wear a blood-red demon mask

00:21:52.070 --> 00:21:53.380
and stand beside the Patriarch.

00:21:54.550 --> 00:21:55.380
Who else could you be

00:21:56.030 --> 00:21:56.940
but Kui?

00:21:57.480 --> 00:21:58.700
Your understanding of us

00:22:00.270 --> 00:22:01.460
is much deeper than I imagined.

00:22:09.790 --> 00:22:10.380
I also know

00:22:10.790 --> 00:22:11.620
every Kui

00:22:12.350 --> 00:22:13.660
is trained

00:22:13.680 --> 00:22:14.180
as the future Patriarch.

00:22:15.400 --> 00:22:16.860
The last Kui

00:22:18.510 --> 00:22:19.180
is

00:22:20.110 --> 00:22:21.090
dead?

00:22:22.960 --> 00:22:23.420
I'm sorry.

00:22:24.350 --> 00:22:25.290
I couldn't tell you

00:22:26.200 --> 00:22:27.290
about such confidential matters.

00:22:28.310 --> 00:22:29.570
But the last Kui

00:22:30.070 --> 00:22:31.180
is my father.

00:22:34.640 --> 00:22:35.570
Can't I even ask about that?

00:22:36.960 --> 00:22:37.730
You must be kidding, Miss Bai.

00:22:38.510 --> 00:22:39.180
Forget it if you don't believe me.

00:22:39.960 --> 00:22:40.900
Whether someone lives or dies

00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:41.900
seems to be a secret to you.

00:22:42.350 --> 00:22:43.530
But given your sensitive identity,

00:22:44.200 --> 00:22:45.330
you're awfully conspicuous.

00:22:45.750 --> 00:22:46.940
Why not keep that a secret instead?

00:22:47.720 --> 00:22:49.050
I once asked my senior the same thing.

00:22:49.720 --> 00:22:50.420
As assassins,

00:22:51.310 --> 00:22:53.290
we should do everything possible to conceal our identities.

00:22:54.550 --> 00:22:55.290
Why do we

00:22:55.350 --> 00:22:55.980
wear it so plainly

00:22:56.030 --> 00:22:57.330
on our faces?

00:22:58.310 --> 00:22:59.090
What did he say?

00:23:01.110 --> 00:23:02.220
"It's a sense of ceremony.

00:23:02.750 --> 00:23:03.620
You don't understand a thing."

00:23:05.350 --> 00:23:06.860
Why are you suddenly slurring your words?

00:23:07.270 --> 00:23:08.140
I'm not slurring,

00:23:08.790 --> 00:23:09.810
he is.

00:23:14.550 --> 00:23:15.380
That reminds me.

00:23:15.920 --> 00:23:16.620
Could the man I saw

00:23:16.680 --> 00:23:17.460
during the day

00:23:17.880 --> 00:23:18.860
be from your sect?

00:23:19.510 --> 00:23:20.050
Does he carry

00:23:20.110 --> 00:23:21.010
a staff

00:23:21.310 --> 00:23:22.290
with golden rings on it?

00:23:22.680 --> 00:23:23.660
So Uncle Zhe came too.

00:23:24.920 --> 00:23:26.620
And the other one who plays with a dagger.

00:23:27.750 --> 00:23:28.570
That's Changhe.

00:23:29.750 --> 00:23:30.140
Chen the Dragon,

00:23:30.830 --> 00:23:31.330
get ready.

00:23:31.830 --> 00:23:33.290
Take Miss Bai and go now.

00:23:33.830 --> 00:23:34.250
Yes, sir.

00:23:35.160 --> 00:23:35.980
Where are we going?

00:23:36.880 --> 00:23:37.460
Jiuxiao City.

00:23:38.240 --> 00:23:39.660
No one knows Changhe better than I do.

00:23:40.400 --> 00:23:41.620
We've definitely walked into his trap

00:23:41.680 --> 00:23:42.490
by now.

00:23:43.960 --> 00:23:44.380
Yu,

00:23:45.960 --> 00:23:46.530
everything is set.

00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:48.420
Miss Bai,

00:23:49.110 --> 00:23:49.730
this is Mao the Rabbit.

00:23:49.730 --> 00:23:50.310
[Mao the Rabbit, one of the Twelve Zodiacs of Spider Shadow]

00:23:50.310 --> 00:23:51.050
Go with her.

00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:52.570
Take care.

00:23:52.920 --> 00:23:53.330
Lord Kui,

00:23:53.720 --> 00:23:55.660
I hope we'll meet again

00:23:55.920 --> 00:23:56.770
in Jiuxiao City.

00:23:57.310 --> 00:23:58.220
Don't call me Lord Kui.

00:23:59.350 --> 00:24:00.330
Just call me Su Muyu.

00:24:00.590 --> 00:24:01.730
Su Muyu.

00:24:02.400 --> 00:24:03.570
That really is a beautiful name.

00:24:04.110 --> 00:24:04.530
See you.

00:24:22.720 --> 00:24:23.330
You said you made preparations.

00:24:23.400 --> 00:24:24.290
And we're just waiting here?

00:24:26.400 --> 00:24:27.940
The Xie's blade, and the Mu's ghost.

00:24:28.350 --> 00:24:29.570
They're getting impatient.

00:24:29.960 --> 00:24:30.810
But I'm different.

00:24:31.440 --> 00:24:32.250
I'm lazy.

00:24:32.920 --> 00:24:33.770
It's better to follow

00:24:33.830 --> 00:24:34.860
those who hustle.

00:24:35.240 --> 00:24:36.570
I may be slower,

00:24:37.110 --> 00:24:38.180
but never late.

00:24:40.480 --> 00:24:42.140
You broke the news to them,

00:24:42.790 --> 00:24:44.290
and both families sent people here?

00:24:45.790 --> 00:24:47.460
You sly kid.

00:24:48.440 --> 00:24:49.460
Master Su sent you over.

00:24:50.510 --> 00:24:51.980
He's determined to take that seat.

00:24:53.550 --> 00:24:55.660
The cleverest me and the strongest you.

00:24:56.310 --> 00:24:56.700
Uncle Zhe,

00:24:57.240 --> 00:24:58.660
once Blood River's top assassin,

00:24:58.880 --> 00:24:59.940
the previous Lord Kui.

00:25:08.860 --> 00:25:09.690
[Mu and Xie have arrived at the abandoned post on the outskirts. ]

00:25:09.710 --> 00:25:10.750
[Only one of the Three Families has yet to show up.]

00:25:10.750 --> 00:25:11.980
An abandoned post on the outskirts?

00:25:12.400 --> 00:25:13.620
The show's about to start.

00:25:16.310 --> 00:25:16.980
Let's go, Uncle Zhe.

00:25:17.550 --> 00:25:18.860
Master Su

00:25:19.030 --> 00:25:19.900
must be anxious by now.

00:25:30.640 --> 00:25:31.980
As expected

00:25:32.030 --> 00:25:32.810
of the infamous Umbrella Ghost.

00:25:33.960 --> 00:25:34.940
This line marks the boundary.

00:25:35.400 --> 00:25:37.180
Please don't cross it.

00:25:38.070 --> 00:25:39.240
[Xie Qianji, the Xie family]
Purple Boot Ghost and

00:25:39.260 --> 00:25:41.530
Blade Yama of the Xie family.

00:25:41.530 --> 00:25:42.180
[Xie Jinke, the Xie family]

00:25:43.070 --> 00:25:44.700
You shouldn't be here.

00:25:45.640 --> 00:25:46.050
What a bore.

00:25:46.680 --> 00:25:47.250
You saw through us

00:25:47.310 --> 00:25:48.420
right away.

00:25:48.680 --> 00:25:50.050
But our family head heard

00:25:50.200 --> 00:25:51.460
that the Patriarch had been badly injured.

00:25:51.680 --> 00:25:52.860
He was anxious

00:25:53.070 --> 00:25:54.420
and wanted to bring him back

00:25:54.590 --> 00:25:55.730
to the main hall for treatment.

00:25:56.400 --> 00:25:57.530
The Patriarch is fine.

00:25:58.750 --> 00:25:59.980
Whether the Patriarch is fine,

00:26:00.590 --> 00:26:01.860
please allow me

00:26:02.270 --> 00:26:03.490
to see him

00:26:03.920 --> 00:26:04.940
and confirm.

00:26:05.270 --> 00:26:06.460
Otherwise,

00:26:07.030 --> 00:26:07.900
I can't explain it.

00:26:08.880 --> 00:26:10.180
What does that

00:26:11.110 --> 00:26:12.570
have to do with me?

00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:13.700
You don't want us

00:26:13.720 --> 00:26:14.860
to see the Patriarch.

00:26:15.640 --> 00:26:17.250
Do you intend

00:26:18.110 --> 00:26:19.490
to delay the treatment we offer?

00:26:20.510 --> 00:26:21.570
That would be one good reason.

00:26:22.200 --> 00:26:24.010
But for that reason to hold,

00:26:25.200 --> 00:26:26.460
there's only one possibility.

00:26:27.160 --> 00:26:27.810
Kill you?

00:26:29.640 --> 00:26:30.330
That's right.

00:27:00.960 --> 00:27:02.330
A blade hidden in the umbrella?

00:27:02.440 --> 00:27:03.770
Why not show it?

00:27:10.920 --> 00:27:12.700
The Xie family's Wind Whirling Blade.

00:27:13.440 --> 00:27:14.140
Impressive.

00:27:14.920 --> 00:27:15.330
Die!

00:27:37.240 --> 00:27:38.330
Do you really think I'm that weak?

00:27:38.480 --> 00:27:39.490
Inch Blade.

00:27:39.880 --> 00:27:40.700
Good one.

00:27:47.240 --> 00:27:48.770
Tell your family head.

00:27:49.550 --> 00:27:50.660
If he withdraws now,

00:27:51.440 --> 00:27:52.810
the Patriarch

00:27:53.310 --> 00:27:54.420
will pretend

00:27:54.440 --> 00:27:55.330
nothing happened.

00:27:56.160 --> 00:27:57.730
If he keeps being stubborn,

00:27:58.160 --> 00:28:00.460
don't blame the Spider Shadow for being ruthless.

00:28:01.550 --> 00:28:02.420
Are you going to

00:28:03.030 --> 00:28:04.380
spare us?

00:28:05.200 --> 00:28:06.250
Fellow members of the Blood River

00:28:07.510 --> 00:28:08.660
are family.

00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:10.380
Let's go.

00:28:18.510 --> 00:28:19.180
You're here.

00:28:20.640 --> 00:28:21.250
You don't look pleased

00:28:21.270 --> 00:28:22.090
to see me,

00:28:22.750 --> 00:28:24.050
my Lord Kui.

00:28:24.240 --> 00:28:25.420
I knew you'd come,

00:28:26.920 --> 00:28:28.660
but I hoped you'd come later.

00:28:30.270 --> 00:28:31.530
Master Su asked me to relay a message.

00:28:32.110 --> 00:28:33.730
You're part of the Su family.

00:28:35.270 --> 00:28:36.420
Now I am Kui,

00:28:37.240 --> 00:28:38.180
the ghost among men.

00:28:38.720 --> 00:28:39.700
I belong to Blood River,

00:28:39.920 --> 00:28:41.420
not to any single family.

00:28:42.160 --> 00:28:43.330
You're always so serious.

00:28:44.920 --> 00:28:45.980
No fun at all.

00:28:46.720 --> 00:28:47.900
When you were a Nameless,

00:28:48.550 --> 00:28:50.290
you woke up early to practice swordwork.

00:28:50.310 --> 00:28:50.730
You were

00:28:50.750 --> 00:28:52.140
a hardworking practitioner.

00:28:52.550 --> 00:28:53.530
Later, when you became an assassin,

00:28:53.920 --> 00:28:54.570
every mission

00:28:54.590 --> 00:28:55.660
you completed

00:28:55.680 --> 00:28:56.420
was flawless.

00:28:57.200 --> 00:28:58.010
Now you're a Kui,

00:28:58.550 --> 00:28:59.770
and you're still so diligent.

00:29:00.510 --> 00:29:02.220
The Patriarch is dying soon.

00:29:03.440 --> 00:29:04.180
Are you going to throw your life away

00:29:04.240 --> 00:29:05.010
for him?

00:29:05.400 --> 00:29:06.380
The Patriarch is fine.

00:29:07.350 --> 00:29:08.180
You shouldn't have started

00:29:09.160 --> 00:29:10.330
this rumor.

00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:13.010
If he were fine,

00:29:13.720 --> 00:29:14.570
why would he have looked for

00:29:14.640 --> 00:29:16.330
Xin Baicao's martial senior?

00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:19.730
If you kill him

00:29:20.270 --> 00:29:21.460
and take the Dormant Dragon Sword,

00:29:22.200 --> 00:29:22.940
you could get

00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:24.290
what you want most.

00:29:25.030 --> 00:29:25.860
Freedom.

00:29:26.830 --> 00:29:27.420
Right.

00:29:28.270 --> 00:29:30.140
Leave the Su family. Leave the Blood River.

00:29:30.550 --> 00:29:31.730
Go wherever you want.

00:29:31.790 --> 00:29:32.980
Do whatever you like.

00:29:34.640 --> 00:29:35.330
You know

00:29:35.920 --> 00:29:36.730
Blood River has

00:29:36.790 --> 00:29:37.570
never allowed that.

00:29:38.200 --> 00:29:39.290
Yet Master Su

00:29:39.920 --> 00:29:41.010
is willing to make an exception for you.

00:29:41.510 --> 00:29:42.420
What if I say no?

00:29:45.640 --> 00:29:46.420
We are the Sus.

00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:48.420
We've lived in the Su residence for so many years.

00:29:49.070 --> 00:29:49.810
You've only followed him

00:29:49.830 --> 00:29:51.380
for years as a Kui.

00:29:52.480 --> 00:29:53.420
How deep can your bond with him

00:29:53.720 --> 00:29:54.700
be compared to the Su family?

00:29:55.480 --> 00:29:56.460
I don't care

00:29:56.480 --> 00:29:57.250
what you think.

00:29:58.310 --> 00:29:59.220
Right now I am Kui,

00:30:00.030 --> 00:30:00.620
and my duty is

00:30:00.640 --> 00:30:02.250
to keep the Patriarch safe.

00:30:02.750 --> 00:30:03.420
Everything

00:30:04.240 --> 00:30:04.980
or every condition

00:30:05.880 --> 00:30:06.420
mustn't

00:30:06.480 --> 00:30:07.730
go beyond this.

00:30:20.550 --> 00:30:21.380
Yes.

00:30:22.160 --> 00:30:22.940
That's right.

00:30:24.310 --> 00:30:24.730
I replied to Master Su

00:30:24.750 --> 00:30:25.980
exactly the same thing.

00:30:26.550 --> 00:30:27.090
I knew

00:30:27.110 --> 00:30:28.010
you'd say that.

00:30:28.590 --> 00:30:29.250
And?

00:30:29.790 --> 00:30:31.090
And he said,

00:30:32.270 --> 00:30:33.090
"If that's the case,

00:30:33.920 --> 00:30:34.700
kill him."
