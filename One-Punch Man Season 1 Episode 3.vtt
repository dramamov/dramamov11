00:00.000 --> 00:04.490
The Obsessive Scientist

00:05.790 --> 00:10.400
<b>Long ago there existed a brilliant young scientist.</b>

00:13.790 --> 00:16.760
<b>By dint of his astonishing genius,</b>

00:16.760 --> 00:19.490
<b>he was able to make a number of 
contributions to human knowledge.</b>

00:23.030 --> 00:28.690
<b>Eventually, however, he became 
disillusioned with the world.</b>

00:30.700 --> 00:33.480
<b>Though constantly showered with praise for the subtlety of his mind,</b>

00:33.480 --> 00:36.860
<b>none of his ideas or theories ever received</b>

00:36.860 --> 00:40.350
<b>even the slightest support from the scientific community.</b>

00:40.890 --> 00:43.390
<b>"We should not be striving to advance human civilization,</b>

00:45.630 --> 00:51.680
<b>but rather the artificial evolution of humans as a species."</b>

00:51.680 --> 00:55.620
<b>That was the only dream he had ever had,</b>

00:55.620 --> 00:59.330
<b>but not a single person came forward to help him fulfill that dream.</b>

00:59.330 --> 01:01.290
<b>Damn these apes!</b>

01:01.780 --> 01:05.540
<b>"Dangerous ideas"? Writing about me as if I were some freak...</b>

01:06.190 --> 01:11.300
<b>Do they really think humans have come this far by avoiding risks?</b>

01:11.300 --> 01:15.450
<b>Idiots who think they no longer need to evolve</b>

01:16.050 --> 01:19.140
<b>have no right to pass on their genes!</b>

01:19.140 --> 01:22.180
<b>Of course, this plan was always for my own sake.</b>

01:23.080 --> 01:26.240
<b>I will carry it out... Even if I must do it all myself!</b>

01:29.850 --> 01:32.940
<b>Thereafter, he devoted himself to research.</b>

01:32.940 --> 01:37.610
<b>It was only after he turned 70 that his efforts began to yield results.</b>

01:45.190 --> 01:48.980
<b>First, the scientist regained his youth.</b>

01:48.980 --> 01:52.880
<b>Next, he began cloning himself.</b>

01:53.670 --> 01:57.680
<b>He named his laboratory the "House of Evolution",</b>

01:57.680 --> 01:59.380
<b>and together with his clones</b>

01:59.380 --> 02:04.580
<b>he conducted countless experiments with animals to create new species.</b>

02:04.580 --> 02:07.570
<b>Eventually, his experiments shifted to human subjects—</b>

02:07.570 --> 02:08.350
<b>This is taking too long!</b>

02:09.020 --> 02:10.160
<b>...Huh?</b>

02:10.160 --> 02:14.110
<b>What's this got to do with me? 
You're just trying to act cool again.</b>

02:15.610 --> 02:18.360
<b>Just get to the point, okay?</b>

02:18.780 --> 02:23.080
<b>Sensei is a busy man. 
Summarize it in 20 words or less.</b>

02:24.990 --> 02:27.400

04:48.850 --> 04:50.180
<b>Oh. Yes?</b>

04:50.180 --> 04:51.970
<b>I have one last question.</b>

04:51.970 --> 04:56.730
<b>Was the "House of Evolution" developing cyborgs prior to four years ago?</b>

04:57.190 --> 04:58.820
<b>How many more cyborgs are there?</b>

04:58.820 --> 05:01.530
<b>Have any of them destroyed towns in the past?</b>

05:02.440 --> 05:03.570
<b>I'm not sure,</b>

05:03.570 --> 05:07.280
<b>but at the "House of Evolution", I'm the only combat cyborg.</b>

05:10.580 --> 05:11.740
<b>Impossible!</b>

05:12.120 --> 05:16.620
<b>Our elite force, formed for the extermination of these obsolete humans, was wiped out?!</b>

05:16.620 --> 05:22.130
<b>According to Armored Gorilla's report, 
the two responsible are on their way here.</b>

05:24.300 --> 05:26.470
<b>If they come,</b>

05:26.470 --> 05:31.010
<b>all our research, everything we've 
been working on, could be destroyed.</b>

05:31.010 --> 05:32.890
<b>This is a serious matter.</b>

05:34.930 --> 05:37.190
<b>The only option is to use our trump card.</b>

05:38.860 --> 05:42.110
<b>Begin preparations for the release of Carnage Kabuto.</b>

05:43.110 --> 05:43.780
<b>What?!</b>

05:43.780 --> 05:45.150
<b>No, not him!</b>

05:44.490 --> 05:45.610
<b>That's crazy!</b>

05:46.030 --> 05:49.120
<b>He'll finally be released?</b>

05:46.030 --> 05:49.120
<b>He's right. That might be the only way.</b>

05:49.410 --> 05:51.780
<b>But maybe we should stop him.</b>

05:49.410 --> 05:51.780
<b>It's too dangerous.</b>

05:51.780 --> 05:53.330
<b>I have a bad feeling about this.</b>

05:52.200 --> 05:53.330
<b>Is that the only way?</b>

05:53.330 --> 05:56.620
<b>Be calm! He will be our last resort.</b>

05:57.460 --> 05:59.130
<b>But...</b>

05:59.130 --> 06:03.500
<b>For now we'll activate all of 
our traps from floors 01 to 08.</b>

06:03.500 --> 06:05.720
<b>If we're lucky, they will take care of the intruders.</b>

06:06.970 --> 06:09.390
<b>I'm fully aware of what will happen to me</b>

06:10.220 --> 06:11.970
<b>should we fail.</b>

06:14.720 --> 06:17.690
<b>I didn't think we'd be running the whole way.</b>

06:17.690 --> 06:19.480
<b>How else are we gonna get there?</b>

06:19.480 --> 06:23.020
<b>I was sure you could fly or something.</b>

06:23.020 --> 06:25.110
<b>Humans can't fly, you know.</b>

06:25.690 --> 06:27.860
<b>It's amazing that you are never late.</b>

<b>...the "House of Evolution".</b>

06:44.050 --> 06:46.960
<b>One, two, three, four, five, six...</b>

06:47.470 --> 06:49.760
<b>Looks like it's about eight stories high—</b>

07:00.980 --> 07:05.110
<b>Uh... what was that all of a sudden?</b>

07:05.110 --> 07:11.570
<b>Well, I decided it would be most efficient to destroy them all in one fell swoop.</b>

07:12.570 --> 07:14.530
<b>Well, that's true, but...</b>

07:14.530 --> 07:17.830
<b>We could have at least seen what the bad guys had in store for us.</b>

07:17.830 --> 07:20.370
<b>That was kind of mean.</b>

07:26.050 --> 07:27.800
<b>Looks like there's a basement.</b>

07:40.480 --> 07:43.020
<b>S-Stop!</b>

07:59.160 --> 08:01.790
<b>Hey, Carnage Kabuto.</b>

08:01.790 --> 08:04.080
<b>Are you well?</b>

08:04.080 --> 08:07.630
<b>It appears you've killed a bunch of my clones again.</b>

08:08.250 --> 08:09.760
<b>Satisfied?</b>

08:09.760 --> 08:10.800
<b>Huh?</b>

08:13.050 --> 08:15.800
<b>Fool! Why would I be satisfied?</b>

08:15.800 --> 08:19.350
<b>I've been kept locked up deep beneath the Earth.</b>

08:19.640 --> 08:21.730
<b>Me! The strongest warrior in the entire "House of Evolution".</b>

08:25.650 --> 08:28.650
<b>You are mentally unstable.</b>

08:28.650 --> 08:32.400
<b>We couldn't control you. There was no choice.</b>

08:32.400 --> 08:37.870
<b>Control? You moron!</b>

08:37.870 --> 08:42.540
<b>I am the culmination of the "New Human" you guys have sought for so long.</b>

08:42.540 --> 08:47.670
<b>My intelligence and physical strength are incomparable to your own!</b>

08:47.670 --> 08:52.880
<b><i>You</i> should be the ones obeying <i>me</i>.</b>

08:54.340 --> 08:56.890
<b><i>No. You're a failure.</i></b>

08:56.890 --> 08:59.140
<b><i>It's true you perform at unheard of levels,</i></b>

08:59.140 --> 09:00.390
<b><i>but it is humanity you lack.</i></b>

09:01.310 --> 09:05.640
<b>Go ahead, kill me. Plenty of clones could take my place.</b>

09:05.640 --> 09:07.270
<b>Oh?</b>

09:07.270 --> 09:08.650
<b>But I have a favor to ask first.</b>

09:09.650 --> 09:12.490
<b>There's a specimen I must have.</b>

09:13.900 --> 09:18.410
<b>He is extremely strong. Only you can defeat him.</b>

09:19.280 --> 09:21.580
<b>I want you to catch him for me...</b>

09:24.370 --> 09:26.370
<b>...dead or alive.</b>

09:29.040 --> 09:31.090
<b>This basement is huge!</b>

09:31.090 --> 09:32.960
<b>I'm getting kind of fired up.</b>

09:35.720 --> 09:36.880
<b>Huh?</b>

09:36.880 --> 09:38.760
<b>I sense living beings further ahead...</b>

09:40.100 --> 09:43.560
<b>Sensei, two of them are approaching.</b>

09:46.480 --> 09:48.230
<b>Oh, here we go!</b>

09:48.730 --> 09:51.400
<b>There are two. Which one is it?</b>

09:51.440 --> 09:52.860
<b>The one on the right...</b>

09:52.860 --> 09:56.610
<b>In that case, you don't need the one on the left!</b>

09:58.360 --> 09:59.570
<b>Genos?</b>

10:00.910 --> 10:02.080
<b>Huh?</b>

10:03.040 --> 10:03.910
<b>Hey...</b>

10:05.750 --> 10:08.500
<b>I am Carnage Kabuto!</b>

10:08.500 --> 10:11.590
<b>We got a combat experimentation room.</b>

10:12.130 --> 10:15.090
<b>Let's do this in there.</b>

10:15.380 --> 10:18.340
<b>You turned Genos into a piece of modern art.</b>

10:19.890 --> 10:21.970
<b>Fight's on!</b>

10:30.150 --> 10:31.730
<b>Pretty big, eh?</b>

10:31.980 --> 10:34.900
<b>It's the biggest room in the facility.</b>

10:34.900 --> 10:40.990
<b>This is where they make us fight 
to test our combat abilities.</b>

10:41.450 --> 10:45.540
<b>Well then, let's start the killing—</b>

10:48.330 --> 10:49.080
<b>Oh?</b>

10:49.620 --> 10:52.080
<b>Still alive, huh?</b>

11:13.560 --> 11:16.440
<b>You fool!</b>

11:16.730 --> 11:18.190
<b>Machinegun Blows!</b>

11:31.790 --> 11:33.210
<b>He got me.</b>

11:33.670 --> 11:35.000
<b>Let me...</b>

11:36.130 --> 11:37.170
<b>... take him...</b>

11:37.760 --> 11:41.180
<b>Your face is all cracked. Don't push yourself.</b>

11:48.640 --> 11:50.680
<b>With his breath? Impossible!</b>

11:55.610 --> 11:57.360
<b>Genos, you okay?</b>

11:57.360 --> 11:59.280
<b>Yes...</b>

12:00.860 --> 12:03.780
<b>No, you're not! Look at your head!</b>

12:09.950 --> 12:13.790
<b>You've gone and gotten my hopes up.</b>

12:33.890 --> 12:39.230
<b><i>I have always been critical of 
humans and their inferior abilities.</i></b>

12:39.980 --> 12:44.740
<b><i>The entire species, aside from myself, 
should be viewed only as dumb animals.</i></b>

12:45.110 --> 12:47.780
<b><i>That realization was agony for me.</i></b>

12:48.160 --> 12:51.540
<b><i>If memory serves, I was 15 when it occurred to me.</i></b>

12:52.250 --> 12:54.960
<b><i>A plan to evolve the human animal</i></b>

12:54.960 --> 12:58.840
<b><i>and create a world where I could live contentedly.</i></b>

12:58.840 --> 13:00.750
<b><i>A utopia of my own, created by me.</i></b>

13:00.750 --> 13:03.170
<b><i>A world made up of only us,</i></b>

13:03.170 --> 13:09.810
<b><i>the new human breed that will transcend humanity!</i></b>

13:18.020 --> 13:19.570
<b><i>I must see it through.</i></b>

13:20.980 --> 13:26.950
<b><i>Compared to my anguish back then, 
this physical pain I feel now is nothing.</i></b>

13:27.570 --> 13:30.700
<b>What's the hold up? Let's go!</b>

13:30.700 --> 13:32.490
<b>Give me all you've got.</b>

13:33.790 --> 13:35.910
<b><i>Carnage Kabuto—a demon incarnate,</i></b>

13:35.910 --> 13:38.830
<b><i>the strongest and most brutal 
creation of the House of Evolution.</i></b>

13:39.540 --> 13:42.880
<b><i>Let's see how you, at your archaic 
stage of human development,</i></b>

13:42.880 --> 13:46.340
<b><i>fare against a monster that is the final form of artificial evolution.</i></b>

13:46.680 --> 13:51.100
<b><i>Or will you be the trigger for a new evolution?</i></b>

13:52.140 --> 13:54.220
<b><i>I can't wait to find out!</i></b>

13:57.230 --> 14:02.440
<b>Oh, I see it. I see it! You're supposed to be strong.</b>

14:02.440 --> 14:04.110
<b>Don't disappoint me now.</b>

14:04.570 --> 14:07.280
<b>You're this place's ultimate weapon, right?</b>

14:07.280 --> 14:09.870
<b>You're clearly not the same as 
the guys from this morning.</b>

14:10.320 --> 14:13.160
<b>Look at you, just oozing with confidence.</b>

14:18.170 --> 14:19.120
<b><i>Such speed!</i></b>

14:29.260 --> 14:30.470
<b>What are you doing?</b>

14:31.800 --> 14:32.470
<b>Hey.</b>

14:35.890 --> 14:37.390
<b>He just backed off?</b>

14:37.390 --> 14:39.770
<b>Carnage Kabuto?!</b>

14:40.600 --> 14:44.360
<b><i>If I'd attacked him just now, he'd have killed me.</i></b>

14:44.360 --> 14:46.780
<b><i>Who the hell is this guy?</i></b>

14:47.190 --> 14:49.320
<b><i>He's leaving himself wide open,</i></b>

14:49.320 --> 14:53.370
<b><i>yet all my instincts are screaming, sending out danger signals!</i></b>

14:53.910 --> 14:54.790
<b>Huh?</b>

14:54.790 --> 14:57.040
<b>You bastard!</b>

14:57.330 --> 15:03.040
<b>How the hell did you get that strong?!</b>

15:10.880 --> 15:12.720
<b>So you wanna know too?</b>

15:14.140 --> 15:15.260
<b>Okay, fine.</b>

15:17.680 --> 15:19.600
<b>Genos, you listen carefully too.</b>

15:20.810 --> 15:23.310
<b><i>He's going to tell us right now?</i></b>

15:23.310 --> 15:26.650
<b><i>The secret to Sensei's power...?</i></b>

15:26.650 --> 15:28.190
<b>I'd like to know too.</b>

15:29.780 --> 15:30.490
<b>Huh?</b>

15:30.900 --> 15:31.910
<b>Who are you?</b>

15:31.910 --> 15:33.280
<b>I am Genus.</b>

15:36.080 --> 15:39.500
<b>Well, fine. Listen up.</b>

15:39.830 --> 15:44.040
<b><i>It's too risky! He can't let these guys know his secret!</i></b>

15:44.750 --> 15:50.550
<b>First, what's important is, to make sure 
you stick to this intense training regimen.</b>

15:51.720 --> 15:56.260
<b><i>Training? Not modification surgery or genetic enhancement,</i></b>

15:56.260 --> 15:58.020
<b><i>but training?</i></b>

15:58.020 --> 16:00.640
<b><i>What training...?</i></b>

16:02.480 --> 16:04.440
<b>Listen, Genos.</b>

16:05.360 --> 16:06.900
<b>You just have to keep doing it.</b>

16:08.480 --> 16:11.030
<b>No matter how hard it gets.</b>

16:11.610 --> 16:14.530
<b>It took me three years to get this strong.</b>

16:16.200 --> 16:20.870
<b>One hundred push-ups! One hundred sit-ups!</b>

16:20.870 --> 16:22.710
<b>One hundred squats!</b>

16:23.420 --> 16:25.670
<b>Then a ten kilometer run.</b>

16:25.960 --> 16:28.170
<b>Every single day!</b>

16:36.680 --> 16:39.560
<b>And of course, make sure you eat three meals a day.</b>

16:40.390 --> 16:45.600
<b>Just a banana in the morning is fine. But the most important thing is</b>

16:43.270 --> 16:49.020
Save

16:43.270 --> 16:49.020
money

16:45.600 --> 16:48.570
<b>to never use the A/C or heat in the summer or winter.</b>

16:52.900 --> 16:55.410
<b>In the beginning, you'll wish you were dead.</b>

16:56.070 --> 16:59.910
<b>You might start thinking, 
"where's the harm in taking a day off?"</b>

17:01.160 --> 17:06.500
<b>But for me, in order to be a strong hero, no matter how tough it was,</b>

17:06.500 --> 17:09.670
<b>even if I was spitting blood, I never stopped.</b>

17:10.340 --> 17:13.670
<b>I kept doing squats even when my legs were so heavy they refused to move.</b>

17:14.260 --> 17:17.220
<b>Even when my arms started making weird clicking noises,</b>

17:17.220 --> 17:19.140
<b>I kept doing push-ups.</b>

17:20.850 --> 17:24.020
<b>A year and a half later, I started to notice a difference.</b>

17:24.020 --> 17:25.980
<b>I was bald...</b>

17:26.520 --> 17:28.650
<b>And I had become stronger!</b>

17:29.980 --> 17:34.780
<b>In other words, you gotta train like hell to the point where your hair falls out.</b>

17:34.780 --> 17:38.160
<b>That's the only way to become strong.</b>

17:39.950 --> 17:41.540
<b>The guys that are fooling around with</b>

17:41.540 --> 17:46.750
<b>the "new human race" and evolution junk will never make it this far.</b>

17:47.120 --> 17:51.090
<b>Human beings are strong because we have the ability to change ourselves.</b>

17:51.090 --> 17:53.760
<b><i>W-What?</i></b>

17:53.760 --> 17:55.760
<b><i>Is this guy... for real?</i></b>

17:56.550 --> 17:57.930
<b><i>Sensei...</i></b>

17:59.090 --> 18:00.850
<b><i>You are so...</i></b>

18:02.100 --> 18:03.770
<b>full of crap!</b>

18:03.770 --> 18:04.930
<b>Huh?</b>

18:04.930 --> 18:08.230
<b>That is nothing but standard strength training!</b>

18:08.980 --> 18:13.190
<b>And it's not even that intense! It's just a normal level!</b>

18:13.190 --> 18:21.620
<b>I... I have to get stronger. I didn't ask to study under you just to hear jokes!</b>

18:23.540 --> 18:25.950
<b>Saitama-sensei,</b>

18:25.950 --> 18:29.370
<b>your power is clearly stronger than what you'd get from just training your body.</b>

18:29.370 --> 18:32.130
<b><i>That's right, I want to know your—</i></b>

18:32.500 --> 18:34.960
<b>We want to know your true secret!</b>

18:36.970 --> 18:38.180
<b>Genos...</b>

18:39.550 --> 18:42.890
<b>You may not believe me, but that's really all I did.</b>

18:43.760 --> 18:45.600
<b>Oh yeah?</b>

18:49.350 --> 18:50.810
<b>No! Carnage Kabuto!</b>

18:51.560 --> 18:56.320
<b>If you don't wanna tell us your secret... so be it.</b>

18:57.610 --> 19:00.070
<b>Stop! You'll go on another rampage!</b>

19:00.990 --> 19:04.740
<b>I bet you aren't stronger than me anyway!</b>

19:08.460 --> 19:13.380
<b>But, since you pissed me off,</b>

19:13.380 --> 19:16.130
<b>I'm gonna annihilate you.</b>
