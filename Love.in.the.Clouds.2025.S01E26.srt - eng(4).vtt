That's why I schemed to get close to you.

So you plotted step by step,

00:15:07.320 --> 00:15:08.820
just to gain my trust

00:15:08.870 --> 00:15:10.010

If you had succeeded,

00:15:13.750 --> 00:15:16.340
would you have killed me to vent your anger?

00:15:19.550 --> 00:15:20.530
I didn't think that far.

00:15:21.270 --> 00:15:22.420
Think about it now.

00:15:25.720 --> 00:15:28.340
Yes. If you had used Heavenly Grief

to defeat me during Qingyun Tournament,

00:15:30.360 --> 00:15:31.700

But

00:15:33.750 --> 00:15:35.700
I would've waited until Qingyun Tournament

00:15:35.720 --> 00:15:37.770
and defeated you fair and square

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:39.060
before taking my revenge.

00:15:43.870 --> 00:15:46.770
That's exactly what I thought you would say.

00:16:00.550 --> 00:16:03.610
Back then, you even asked me

00:16:04.240 --> 00:16:05.650
if I was the one who poisoned you.

00:16:06.630 --> 00:16:08.530

Yes.

00:16:10.670 --> 00:16:11.340
And

00:16:11.870 --> 00:16:13.980
when you helped me steal Master's portrait,

00:16:14.790 --> 00:16:16.490
you weren't completely sincere, were you?

00:16:18.320 --> 00:16:20.460
But when we reached Xun Ming's Illusory Realm,

you were the one who saved me.

At that time,

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:27.820

more important to me than I thought.

00:17:21.110 --> 00:17:21.940
What are you doing?

00:17:42.070 --> 00:17:43.570
I can feel that she means no harm.

00:18:25.680 --> 00:18:27.090
Haven't we been here before?

00:19:17.030 --> 00:19:18.250
I'm afraid something might happen to her.

00:19:18.790 --> 00:19:19.860
I'll go in with her.

00:19:23.920 --> 00:19:24.530
Ming Yi!

00:19:33.070 --> 00:19:34.010
Will she be in danger?

00:19:36.110 --> 00:19:37.220
Why can't I go in?

00:19:53.270 --> 00:19:55.700
Is this the Bo clan's ancestral home?

00:20:41.920 --> 00:20:44.570
Ming Xian, I've been waiting for you for so long.

00:20:45.590 --> 00:20:47.180
Fairy Bo Yulan.

00:20:51.110 --> 00:20:52.620
How do you know I'm Ming Xian?

00:20:55.350 --> 00:20:56.530
What you see now

00:20:57.310 --> 00:21:00.180
is the illusion of me and my sister, Bo Yucen.

00:21:01.590 --> 00:21:02.940
For any descendant of the Bo clan,

00:21:03.920 --> 00:21:06.050
as long as our portraits are still worshipped,

00:21:06.440 --> 00:21:07.810
our final divine consciousness

00:21:08.070 --> 00:21:10.660
will remain within this ancestral home.

00:21:13.310 --> 00:21:14.420
Fairy Bo Yulan.

00:21:14.880 --> 00:21:16.220
Ji Bozai is still outside.

00:21:16.590 --> 00:21:17.660
Why not let him in?

00:21:19.400 --> 00:21:20.140
Ming Xian.

00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:23.980
I no longer have the face to see Ji Bozai.

00:21:24.920 --> 00:21:26.010
Please tell him for me

00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:28.290
that I owe him forever.

00:21:29.400 --> 00:21:31.140
It's a debt I can never repay, even in death.

00:21:35.270 --> 00:21:37.290
What do you mean by that?

00:21:41.160 --> 00:21:42.220
Some truths

00:21:44.200 --> 00:21:47.420
are actually right in front of Ji Bozai.

00:21:48.200 --> 00:21:50.290
But those truths are too unbearable.

00:21:51.640 --> 00:21:53.660
I'm afraid if he learns them,

00:21:54.440 --> 00:21:56.140
it would shatter his trust

00:21:56.310 --> 00:21:57.570
in everyone and everything.

00:22:00.920 --> 00:22:02.290
If he insists on facing,

00:22:04.110 --> 00:22:04.980
my memories

00:22:06.030 --> 00:22:08.290
are right within his reach.

00:22:08.510 --> 00:22:09.420
What do you mean by that?

00:22:09.880 --> 00:22:11.660
What exactly happened between you two?

00:22:16.310 --> 00:22:18.980
Child, this matter has nothing to do with you.

00:22:19.440 --> 00:22:20.900
You came here for Golden Millet Dream.

00:22:21.200 --> 00:22:22.010
In this world,

00:22:22.270 --> 00:22:24.460
there's no one more suitable to entrust it to than you.

00:22:25.920 --> 00:22:27.290
Once you retrieve the recipe,

00:22:28.400 --> 00:22:30.220
we will finally be able to rest in peace.

00:22:32.480 --> 00:22:35.660
Descendants of the Bo clan were never meant to let Golden Millet Dream reappear.

00:22:36.200 --> 00:22:38.460
I once made Ji Bozai swear to me

00:22:38.790 --> 00:22:40.900
to guard Golden Millet Dream with his life.

00:22:42.510 --> 00:22:43.900
But times have changed.

00:22:44.110 --> 00:22:45.250
If it's to save lives

00:22:45.640 --> 00:22:47.010
and save even more people,

00:22:47.640 --> 00:22:51.330
perhaps letting Golden Millet Dream resurface is even more meaningful.

00:22:53.200 --> 00:22:53.900
In that case,

00:22:54.200 --> 00:22:56.460
thank you for being willing to hand me the recipe.

00:22:57.270 --> 00:22:58.490
Once I refine Golden Millet Dream

00:22:58.510 --> 00:22:59.380
and cure the poison,

00:22:59.680 --> 00:23:01.530
I will return it to the Bo clan's descendants.

00:23:01.550 --> 00:23:03.050
I won't let outsiders take it.

00:23:10.270 --> 00:23:11.090
Good girl.

00:23:13.350 --> 00:23:16.570
Now, the Bo clan has only one descendant left in this world.

00:23:17.440 --> 00:23:18.770
And that's my child.

00:23:19.920 --> 00:23:20.860
But I hope

00:23:22.270 --> 00:23:24.770
no one will ever know her identity or whereabouts.

00:23:25.030 --> 00:23:28.090
And no one should ever find her.

00:23:30.880 --> 00:23:32.180
There's not much time, Ming Xian.

00:23:32.440 --> 00:23:33.460
I want you to swear.

00:23:34.400 --> 00:23:35.810
Even in the face of the deepest abyss,

00:23:36.030 --> 00:23:38.490
you will still protect all living beings, even at the cost of your life.

00:23:39.030 --> 00:23:40.050
If you break this oath,

00:23:40.640 --> 00:23:43.490
your primordial spirit shall perish, and your soul scattered through Six Realms.

00:23:54.400 --> 00:23:55.220
I swear,

00:23:55.720 --> 00:23:57.180
even in the face of the deepest abyss,

00:23:57.400 --> 00:23:59.140
I will protect all living beings, even at the cost of my life.

00:23:59.750 --> 00:24:00.940
If I break this oath,

00:24:01.070 --> 00:24:03.140
my primordial spirit shall perish, and my soul scattered through Six Realms.

00:24:12.550 --> 00:24:14.010
This is the rest of the recipe.

00:24:15.270 --> 00:24:16.900
We intentionally made outsiders believe

00:24:17.680 --> 00:24:19.900
that Part 2 of the Medical Classics was just a book.

00:24:20.590 --> 00:24:24.250
But the Bo clan actually has another secret method.

00:24:29.920 --> 00:24:32.380
Ming Xian, you now possess the recipe.

00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:33.730
We

00:24:35.110 --> 00:24:36.380
have no more regrets.

00:24:37.350 --> 00:24:39.250
Good child, go now.

00:24:40.790 --> 00:24:41.490
Fairy.

00:24:41.790 --> 00:24:43.050
Ji Bozai is just outside.

00:24:43.200 --> 00:24:44.250
Go and see him.

00:25:05.160 --> 00:25:05.730
Ming Yi.

00:25:05.870 --> 00:25:06.860
- Ji Bozai. - Are you alright?

00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:08.730
Ji Bozai, I saw your master.

00:25:08.880 --> 00:25:10.900
If you go in now, you should still be able to see her one last time.

00:25:13.200 --> 00:25:13.980
How could this be?

00:25:15.270 --> 00:25:16.250
Why...

00:25:21.640 --> 00:25:23.250
What just happened?

00:25:24.510 --> 00:25:25.940
I'm sorry. I don't understand either.

00:25:26.920 --> 00:25:28.620
After Fairy Bo gave me the recipe,

00:25:28.830 --> 00:25:30.290
I begged her to see you.

00:25:30.550 --> 00:25:32.180
She said she wronged you.

00:25:32.880 --> 00:25:34.700
And she said she hid the truth

00:25:34.720 --> 00:25:36.570
right within your reach.

00:25:37.200 --> 00:25:38.620
But she feared that once you knew,

00:25:38.790 --> 00:25:41.420
it would destroy your faith in people and in the world.

00:25:46.270 --> 00:25:47.180
That's impossible.

00:25:47.920 --> 00:25:50.010
Master traded her life for mine.

00:25:50.310 --> 00:25:51.700
How could she have wronged me?

00:25:52.750 --> 00:25:54.380
I just don't understand

00:25:58.200 --> 00:25:59.810
why Master won't see me.

00:26:03.070 --> 00:26:04.290
What's going on?

00:26:05.720 --> 00:26:06.620
Impossible.

00:26:07.640 --> 00:26:08.730
The Bo clan's divine consciousness

00:26:09.270 --> 00:26:10.810
and the Zhulong Barrier can only recognize

00:26:12.110 --> 00:26:13.420
descendants of the Bo clan.

00:26:16.550 --> 00:26:20.180
Ji Bozai can't enter the Bo clan's ancestral home,

00:26:21.110 --> 00:26:22.460
but Ming Xian can.

00:26:24.510 --> 00:26:25.490
There's another possibility.

00:26:27.640 --> 00:26:28.530
Ming Xian's...

Everything went exactly as Your Majesty foresaw.

00:26:55.110 --> 00:26:56.380
His Highness originally believed

00:26:56.400 --> 00:26:57.940
that Ji Bozai was the descendant of the Bo clan,

00:26:58.200 --> 00:26:59.660
so he lured him to Zhangwei Mountain.

00:27:00.310 --> 00:27:02.090
But following Your Majesty's orders,

00:27:02.480 --> 00:27:03.420
I stayed hidden at Zhangwei Mountain

00:27:03.790 --> 00:27:04.660
and actually saw

00:27:05.110 --> 00:27:07.460
that the Zhulong Barrier accepted not Ji Bozai,

00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:10.330
but his wife, Ming Yi.

00:27:12.720 --> 00:27:13.570
As expected.

00:27:14.960 --> 00:27:17.460
The one truly able to inherit the Bo clan's bloodline

00:27:18.200 --> 00:27:19.290
should indeed be

00:27:19.310 --> 00:27:21.250
a fairy with spiritual veins.

00:27:21.640 --> 00:27:24.050
Go investigate Ming Yi's true identity.

00:27:24.790 --> 00:27:25.860
She cannot possibly

00:27:26.270 --> 00:27:29.420
be a mere fairy

from Jixing Abyss.

00:27:30.510 --> 00:27:31.180
Yes.

00:27:31.960 --> 00:27:33.570
Judging from Ming Yi's expression

00:27:33.920 --> 00:27:34.860
she must have already obtained

00:27:34.880 --> 00:27:36.290
the other half of Bo's Medical Classics.

00:27:36.640 --> 00:27:39.050
His Highness has lived up to Your Majesty's trust.

00:27:39.590 --> 00:27:42.490
Your Majesty will soon be able to create Golden Millet Dream.

A full 100 years.

00:27:52.680 --> 00:27:56.180
Once I obtain Heavenly Grief and Golden Millet Dream,

00:27:57.750 --> 00:28:00.730
I can finally activate Sky-Swallowing Array.

After 100 years of patience, your grand scheme will be complete.

Leaving everything in Chao Yuan's hands

00:28:08.200 --> 00:28:09.530
was truly the right choice.

00:28:10.270 --> 00:28:11.220
Tell him.

00:28:12.270 --> 00:28:13.940
Once he has the complete recipe,

00:28:14.350 --> 00:28:17.250
he is to return to Zhushui Spiritual State immediately to refine the medicine.

00:28:17.720 --> 00:28:18.330
Yes.

his Aranya Barrier can stop me?

Once I possess Heavenly Grief and Golden Millet Dream,

00:28:33.160 --> 00:28:36.220
I shall activate Sky-Swallowing Array

the Diwu tree is an ancient divine tree.

It hasn't been gone for 100 or 1,000 years.

It's been extinct for over 10,000 years.

00:30:57.790 --> 00:30:58.490
Alright.

00:31:02.640 --> 00:31:03.460
How is he?

00:31:07.310 --> 00:31:08.900
To die in a beauty's arms

00:31:09.720 --> 00:31:11.010
is romantic.

00:31:12.680 --> 00:31:14.860
I can't watch this.

00:31:27.830 --> 00:31:28.530
I'm fine.

00:31:28.830 --> 00:31:30.330
You're still injured.

00:31:33.720 --> 00:31:35.010
Didn't you see enough already?

00:31:48.030 --> 00:31:48.700
Master.

00:31:49.350 --> 00:31:50.460
I was wounded by Zhulong too.

00:31:50.480 --> 00:31:51.620
Why am I fine?

00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:54.420
And why did she only let me enter the Bo clan's ancestral home?

00:31:54.960 --> 00:31:57.940
Zhulong has a really strange temper.

00:31:57.960 --> 00:31:59.660
Maybe she just likes you

00:31:59.680 --> 00:32:00.570
and hates him.

00:32:02.750 --> 00:32:04.290
Then… Then Fairy Bo...

00:32:04.510 --> 00:32:05.140
Enough.

00:32:05.640 --> 00:32:06.860
What matters most right now

00:32:06.880 --> 00:32:08.050
is finding Diwu tree's core

00:32:08.070 --> 00:32:08.980
to make Golden Millet Dream.

00:32:15.480 --> 00:32:16.980
Take me back to Wugui Sea to heal my wound.

00:32:23.880 --> 00:32:25.050
Why are you looking at me like that?

00:32:25.200 --> 00:32:26.770
You can send him there. Leave me out of this.

00:32:32.030 --> 00:32:33.220
Where does it hurt again?

00:33:10.830 --> 00:33:11.660
Slow down.

00:33:14.920 --> 00:33:16.140
I'll go get Blood-Calming Powder.

00:33:17.400 --> 00:33:18.090
Ming Yi!

00:33:26.640 --> 00:33:27.570
You're injured.

00:33:28.270 --> 00:33:29.250
Has Ming Yi come too?

00:33:29.960 --> 00:33:30.490
Where is she?

00:33:30.790 --> 00:33:31.420
Buxiu.

00:33:35.070 --> 00:33:35.660
I...

00:33:41.960 --> 00:33:42.730
No need to close the door.

00:33:43.310 --> 00:33:44.290
Ming Yi will be back soon.

00:34:25.320 --> 00:34:26.460
What are you doing?

00:34:28.320 --> 00:34:29.090
Checking my wound.

00:34:45.480 --> 00:34:47.130
Are you trying to murder your husband?

00:34:50.670 --> 00:34:53.010
Immortal Ji, mind your words.

00:34:53.030 --> 00:34:54.900
Our relationship is fake from the start.

00:34:54.920 --> 00:34:57.050
Let alone now.

00:34:57.070 --> 00:34:58.780
Go to Marriage Stone and take a look then.

00:34:59.360 --> 00:35:01.090
See if our names are still there.

00:35:02.400 --> 00:35:03.900
But those are fake names.

00:35:04.920 --> 00:35:05.860
Yes.

00:35:06.550 --> 00:35:07.170
But

00:35:08.400 --> 00:35:11.300
I carved them there at a real cost.

00:35:19.440 --> 00:35:23.210
I once thought you were a descendant of the Bo clan.

00:35:26.590 --> 00:35:27.980
I have my own family too.

00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:31.570
My mother once left a mark between my brows,

00:35:33.710 --> 00:35:37.130
but I no longer wish to look for them.

00:35:39.440 --> 00:35:42.170
Do you fear they abandoned you?

00:35:50.920 --> 00:35:52.740
But if Fairy Bo's your master,

00:35:52.960 --> 00:35:55.490
why won't the Zhulong Barrier let you through?

00:35:57.840 --> 00:35:59.780
Perhaps it's her divine consciousness that decided so.

00:36:00.840 --> 00:36:02.130
Maybe she just doesn't wish to see me.

00:36:04.920 --> 00:36:06.380
Master must be hiding something from me.

00:36:07.590 --> 00:36:08.860
I still don't understand that line.

00:36:09.360 --> 00:36:11.210
"The truth lies before my eyes."

00:36:12.070 --> 00:36:13.420
What does it really mean?

00:36:15.920 --> 00:36:18.090
Did she leave anything for you?

00:36:18.280 --> 00:36:19.610
Only Golden Millet Dream.

00:36:20.280 --> 00:36:23.170
But Golden Millet Dream cannot hold divine consciousness.

00:36:27.280 --> 00:36:29.170
You can so naturally

00:36:29.190 --> 00:36:30.860
mention Golden Millet Dream in front of me now.

00:36:31.800 --> 00:36:33.010
You stopped pretending too.

00:36:33.030 --> 00:36:34.570
You clearly know everything about Wugui Sea,

00:36:34.920 --> 00:36:36.570
even where the Blood-Calming Powder is.

00:36:54.920 --> 00:36:57.300
What do you plan to do next?

00:37:07.000 --> 00:37:09.300
Now that I know the recipe for Golden Millet Dream,

00:37:10.190 --> 00:37:11.740
even if everyone says

00:37:11.920 --> 00:37:13.740
Diwu tree's core has vanished from Six Realms,

00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:16.530
I still won't sit here and wait to die.

00:37:17.190 --> 00:37:18.210
I'll go find it.

00:37:18.630 --> 00:37:19.530
I destroyed

00:37:21.070 --> 00:37:22.690
Golden Millet Dream right before your eyes.

00:37:24.070 --> 00:37:25.050
Don't you hate me for that?

00:37:26.670 --> 00:37:28.210
It was yours to begin with.

00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:31.260
You can do whatever you want with it.

00:37:34.400 --> 00:37:35.170
Yes.

00:37:36.510 --> 00:37:38.490
That's why I've already handled it properly.

00:37:41.800 --> 00:37:42.530
You...

00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:44.940
You suffered, didn't you?

00:37:46.360 --> 00:37:48.610
You couldn't even enter the ancestral home

00:37:48.800 --> 00:37:50.300
to see Fairy Bo one last time.

00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:52.010
Fairy Bo's words...

00:37:52.030 --> 00:37:52.820
Master's wronging me

00:37:52.840 --> 00:37:54.050
is nonsense.

00:37:55.440 --> 00:37:56.900
She chose to give you the recipe

00:37:57.590 --> 00:37:58.650
for her own reasons.

00:38:00.840 --> 00:38:02.460
As for what she hid from me,

00:38:03.280 --> 00:38:04.340
I'll find out myself.

00:38:17.510 --> 00:38:18.980
What's wrong? Does the wound hurt again?

00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:19.650
What...

00:38:24.840 --> 00:38:25.570
I'm hungry.

00:38:29.000 --> 00:38:29.980
Come eat with me.

00:38:35.630 --> 00:38:36.690
Ji Bozai, are you

00:38:36.710 --> 00:38:38.050
incapable of taking care of yourself?

00:38:38.070 --> 00:38:39.210
You need company even to eat?

00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:41.980
I got hurt because of you.

00:38:43.190 --> 00:38:43.980
Slow down.

00:38:44.070 --> 00:38:45.980
At least change into clean clothes.

00:38:46.190 --> 00:38:47.130
Fine.

00:38:50.800 --> 00:38:51.780
You said you were hungry.

00:38:52.070 --> 00:38:53.490
I brought the food inside, yet you wouldn't eat.

00:38:53.590 --> 00:38:54.690
You had to come here to eat.

00:38:54.710 --> 00:38:55.340
What are you doing?

00:38:58.360 --> 00:38:59.420
Why are you covering my eyes?

00:38:59.440 --> 00:39:00.090
Ji Bozai.

00:39:02.590 --> 00:39:03.420
Put your hand down.

00:39:03.880 --> 00:39:05.170
You're not in pain anymore, are you?

00:39:07.920 --> 00:39:09.050
Why are you covering my eyes?

00:39:09.070 --> 00:39:09.900
Eat by yourself then.

00:39:29.550 --> 00:39:30.260
Embers.

00:39:32.920 --> 00:39:35.420
I return Embers to you today.

00:39:36.510 --> 00:39:38.210
From now on, whether you stay in Jixing Abyss

00:39:39.110 --> 00:39:40.300
or return to Yaoguang Mountain,

00:39:41.550 --> 00:39:42.820
it will always protect you.

00:39:48.800 --> 00:39:50.650
I can only try to restore its appearance,

00:39:51.320 --> 00:39:54.050
but only you can truly repair it completely.

00:39:55.920 --> 00:39:56.610
Thank you.

00:40:00.710 --> 00:40:03.130
Diwu tree's core is hard to find.

00:40:03.320 --> 00:40:04.460
There's not a single clue.

00:40:05.440 --> 00:40:06.860
To save me, Twenty-Seven

00:40:07.280 --> 00:40:09.570
left only a trace of divine consciousness in that bell.

00:40:11.030 --> 00:40:12.530
I dare not hope for a future.

00:40:17.190 --> 00:40:18.210
I said there will be a future,

00:40:20.360 --> 00:40:21.740
then there definitely will be a future.

00:40:40.590 --> 00:40:43.010
Diwu tree's core is hard to find.

00:40:43.030 --> 00:40:44.210
There's not a single clue.

00:40:45.150 --> 00:40:46.690
To save me, Twenty-Seven

00:40:47.110 --> 00:40:49.210
left only a trace of divine consciousness in that bell.

00:40:51.000 --> 00:40:52.170
I dare not hope for a future.

00:41:04.510 --> 00:41:06.340
Do you want to eat fish?

00:41:07.190 --> 00:41:09.090
You dragons all eat fish, right?

00:41:10.510 --> 00:41:11.340
I have a name.

00:41:11.590 --> 00:41:12.460
Eat and hurry back.

00:41:12.550 --> 00:41:14.570
You won't tell me your name.

00:41:15.190 --> 00:41:15.940
Buxiu.

00:41:16.800 --> 00:41:17.980
I'm Twenty-Seven.

00:41:20.230 --> 00:41:20.980
Buxiu?

00:41:21.110 --> 00:41:22.050
Nice name.

00:41:22.880 --> 00:41:25.300
Honestly, I kind of envy you dragons.

00:41:25.590 --> 00:41:26.900
You're all big and powerful.

00:41:27.070 --> 00:41:30.090
When you take human form, you're quite sturdy.

00:41:31.710 --> 00:41:32.940
You helped me defeat Sun Liao.

00:41:33.150 --> 00:41:34.420
I owe you one.

00:41:34.440 --> 00:41:34.860
No need.

00:41:34.880 --> 00:41:35.530
How about this?

00:41:35.590 --> 00:41:36.860
I'll grant you three wishes.

00:41:38.510 --> 00:41:40.380
No need, don't act on your own.

00:41:45.000 --> 00:41:45.570
How about this?

00:41:45.880 --> 00:41:47.820
The first wish is that I go fishing with you.

00:42:08.920 --> 00:42:11.210
Ming Yi, you're finally back.

00:42:11.630 --> 00:42:12.340
How did it go?

00:42:14.070 --> 00:42:15.260
I found the recipe,

00:42:15.710 --> 00:42:16.980
but we can't gather all the herbs.

00:42:17.280 --> 00:42:18.780
Tell me what else is still missing.

00:42:19.480 --> 00:42:21.490
I'll search the whole world's heavenly treasures.

00:42:21.880 --> 00:42:22.860
As long as I can save you,

00:42:22.880 --> 00:42:24.010
I'll do anything.

00:42:27.480 --> 00:42:30.570
Immortal Situ, I'm very grateful to you.

00:42:31.320 --> 00:42:33.780
But fate runs its course, and each has their destiny.

00:42:34.110 --> 00:42:35.570
- Don't trouble yourself. - You know your way back?

00:42:38.740 --> 00:42:39.620
Why are you still standing there?

00:42:39.620 --> 00:42:40.560
Hurry inside.

00:42:41.030 --> 00:42:43.060
I still need to check the Heavenly Grief in your body.

00:42:44.840 --> 00:42:45.780
Honestly,

00:42:46.630 --> 00:42:48.570
you never let me have a moment's peace.

00:42:54.320 --> 00:42:55.010
I'm not seeing you off.

00:42:55.110 --> 00:42:55.860
Master She.

00:42:56.710 --> 00:42:58.860
Ming Yi refuses to reveal Golden Millet Dream's recipe to me.

00:43:00.550 --> 00:43:03.530
But I really just want to help.

00:43:03.920 --> 00:43:05.860
Tell me what herbs are needed.

00:43:06.000 --> 00:43:07.260
I'll find a way to get them.

00:43:11.480 --> 00:43:12.570
Please, Master She.

00:43:13.590 --> 00:43:14.530
I must save her.

00:43:15.670 --> 00:43:17.460
Even if I have to exchange my life for hers.

00:43:24.440 --> 00:43:26.210
The final catalyst herb is

00:43:27.710 --> 00:43:28.820
Diwu tree's core.

00:43:31.510 --> 00:43:32.610
Diwu tree's core?

00:43:35.630 --> 00:43:36.690
It has been extinct

00:43:38.400 --> 00:43:39.690
for 13,000 years.

00:43:40.800 --> 00:43:41.860
So

00:43:42.150 --> 00:43:44.170
we can't make Golden Millet Dream after all.

00:43:52.150 --> 00:43:52.900
Wait for me.

00:43:54.710 --> 00:43:55.860
I'll find a way.
