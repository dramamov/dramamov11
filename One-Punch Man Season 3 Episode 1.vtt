01:48.025 --> 01:52.487
STRATEGY MEETING

01:48.650 --> 01:51.694
Just when we thought damage
to the city would be inevitable

01:51.695 --> 01:55.115
a powerful attack pulverized
that giant creature.

01:55.324 --> 01:59.286
So you're saying Centichoro
disappeared without a trace?

01:59.953 --> 02:04.166
It's hard to believe, but this is
a feat only King could pull off.

02:04.374 --> 02:07.209
We are incredibly lucky to
have King as our ally.

02:07.210 --> 02:12.341
As for the Hero Hunter, I hear
Silverfang failed to capture him.

02:12.507 --> 02:14.676
What do you plan to do
about this, Sitch?

02:14.968 --> 02:16.719
If he continues to
hunt heroes like this

02:16.720 --> 02:19.306
the Hero Association
will cease to function.

02:20.265 --> 02:25.103
You must no longer view Garou
as a human, but as a monster.

02:25.354 --> 02:27.230
The next time he appears...

02:27.522 --> 02:29.357
He will be categorized as
threat level Dragon

02:29.358 --> 02:31.652
and an emergency alert
must be issued.

02:32.069 --> 02:34.321
But in reality,
he's still a human, right?

02:34.988 --> 02:36.405
Could any normal person actually

02:36.406 --> 02:38.992
stand up to our Class-S heroes
barehanded?

02:39.117 --> 02:40.452
Just think about it.

02:40.952 --> 02:42.621
Maybe the strategy's the problem?

02:42.913 --> 02:44.206
<i>"Our" Class-S heroes?</i>

02:44.331 --> 02:45.373
<i>Even at this stage</i>

02:45.374 --> 02:47.167
<i>he is treating this
as some kind of business.</i>

02:47.834 --> 02:52.129
It was unexpected that Silverfang
failed to finish off Garou

02:52.130 --> 02:54.758
but he did manage to
leave him severely injured.

02:55.175 --> 02:58.094
At least this means
Garou likely won't bolster

02:58.095 --> 02:59.805
the Monster Association's forces.

03:00.013 --> 03:02.307
If nothing else,
we can count that as a win.

03:02.516 --> 03:04.559
Get Blast over here!
Blast, I say!

03:04.851 --> 03:07.479
He's a top-ranker, but he's
not doing anything at all, is he?

03:07.771 --> 03:10.857
It's impossible
to give Blast orders.

03:11.024 --> 03:15.070
He only operates
as a hero voluntarily.

03:15.737 --> 03:19.448
He refuses to be bound by anyone
and dislikes drawing attention

03:19.449 --> 03:22.077
so even in the registry,
his identity is undisclosed.

03:22.619 --> 03:27.499
But that's because we believe he's
worthy of this special treatment.

03:27.791 --> 03:31.335
However, if humanity really needs help

03:31.336 --> 03:33.212
I'm sure he'll take action.

03:33.213 --> 03:34.881
What do you mean?!

03:35.215 --> 03:39.386
That time is now!
A monster abducted my son!

03:40.053 --> 03:42.430
It's been 24 hours since then.

03:42.431 --> 03:44.724
Why haven't you attacked?

03:44.975 --> 03:47.436
I give you my word.
We will save your son.

03:48.186 --> 03:49.020
And you are...?

03:49.521 --> 03:52.357
I'll be commanding
this rescue operation.

03:52.649 --> 03:54.317
My name is Sekingal.

03:54.943 --> 03:56.653
Pleased to make your acquaintance.

03:57.362 --> 03:58.238
Huh?

03:58.905 --> 04:00.991
What operation?

04:01.283 --> 04:05.328
I'll just sweep in and
take care of things in no time.

04:05.620 --> 04:07.372
Do we know where the hideout is?

04:07.831 --> 04:10.667
Child Emperor is working
at full speed on it right now.

04:11.460 --> 04:16.298
I have surveillance robots probing
Centichoro's underground route.

04:16.715 --> 04:19.967
But the area is huge...
we have three days, right?

04:19.968 --> 04:21.052
We only have two days left.

04:21.386 --> 04:23.472
Ugh...
No sleep for me!

04:23.764 --> 04:27.517
The hideout is somewhere
in City Z's ghost town, right?

04:27.726 --> 04:29.895
Shall I just wipe it out?

04:27.726 --> 04:33.023
KABOOM

04:30.020 --> 04:33.023
We must tread carefully
since there is a hostage.

04:33.356 --> 04:35.609
Sounds like a pain in the neck.

04:35.776 --> 04:38.653
If they hadn't done that
they'd have no chance against me.

04:39.154 --> 04:41.531
The monsters must be afraid of me.

04:41.782 --> 04:43.616
The opponents
are pretty formidable.

04:43.617 --> 04:45.035
Yeah, whatever.

04:45.410 --> 04:49.039
Did you call us here just
to give us that warning?

04:51.625 --> 04:52.584
Actually yesterday...

04:52.793 --> 04:55.337
Drive Knight forcibly continued
the investigation on his own.

04:55.670 --> 05:00.217
He ignored our warnings and
entered the ghost town ahead of us.

05:00.926 --> 05:02.093
Why would he go alone?!

05:02.594 --> 05:07.224
He's never lost a battle,
so he must've been confident.

05:07.724 --> 05:08.933
But since last night

05:08.934 --> 05:12.020
we haven't been able to pick up
a signal from his transmitter.

05:12.854 --> 05:16.650
I think it's safe to assume that
Drive Knight has been defeated.

05:18.318 --> 05:19.860
I don't care either way.

05:19.861 --> 05:22.656
You'd better hurry up and
assemble your team.

05:22.948 --> 05:24.199
Who's left?

05:24.825 --> 05:28.870
The Monster Association gave us
a three-day ultimatum.

05:29.079 --> 05:30.247
We still have time.

05:31.456 --> 05:35.669
As soon as the other heroes
are ready, they will rush over too.

05:37.045 --> 05:39.422
Still on standby?
What's going on?

05:40.090 --> 05:42.217
A child is being held hostage?

05:42.592 --> 05:45.178
You didn't know about that,
Atomic Samurai?

05:45.512 --> 05:47.639
You also reek of blood.

05:48.348 --> 05:51.600
Since yesterday, I've been
scouring mountains and caves

05:51.601 --> 05:56.189
looking for hidden monsters and
slashing 'em up, left, and right.

05:57.023 --> 05:58.858
Unfortunately,
I wasn't able to find

05:58.859 --> 06:00.902
the Monster Association's
hideout though.

06:01.403 --> 06:02.487
Yeah, makes sense.

06:02.696 --> 06:06.157
I hear the Monster Association's
hideout is in the ghost town.

06:06.408 --> 06:08.702
What?!
We know that much?

06:09.286 --> 06:12.706
Well, fighting head-on at
the hideout sounds easy enough.

06:13.373 --> 06:15.667
I suggest we all
get some rest till then.

06:15.792 --> 06:18.128
- Okay.
- I'm going to take a shower.

06:20.046 --> 06:20.881
Oh my!

06:21.590 --> 06:25.051
I heard the assault team would
be made up of an elite few, but...

06:25.552 --> 06:28.471
For some reason, there are
some here who don't fit the bill.

06:29.014 --> 06:30.432
This is not a picnic.

06:30.932 --> 06:35.270
How about we refrain from bringing
our fun friends, Atomic Samurai?

06:36.396 --> 06:38.940
I'd like the small fry to stick
to fighting other small fry.

06:39.274 --> 06:40.233
You got that?

06:40.567 --> 06:42.985
It wouldn't be so bad
if they just die

06:42.986 --> 06:45.447
but what if they're taken as
hostages or used as human shields?

06:45.780 --> 06:47.490
That would be a major hassle.

06:48.074 --> 06:49.658
If that ever happens

06:49.659 --> 06:52.329
can you give them the orders
to commit harakiri?

06:52.454 --> 06:54.330
Hey, take it easy, Mr. Handsome...

06:54.331 --> 06:57.042
Amai Mask, are you on the team?

06:57.542 --> 07:02.714
Of course. Those monsters
interrupted my concert.

07:03.089 --> 07:07.636
I see. My disciples are tough,
you know.

07:07.844 --> 07:11.513
I'll tell them to protect
the pretty boy idol

07:11.514 --> 07:13.725
when he gets in trouble.

07:14.059 --> 07:15.685
So relax.

07:16.019 --> 07:17.228
In trouble?

07:17.729 --> 07:19.188
I can't believe there are people

07:19.189 --> 07:21.775
who still doubt
my combat abilities.

07:22.359 --> 07:25.736
I only stay in Class A because
it's easier to oversee everything.

07:25.737 --> 07:27.697
I can move up to Class S
at any time.

07:28.615 --> 07:30.492
Mm, let's see now.

07:30.909 --> 07:33.244
To put it simply,
so an imbecile can understand...

07:33.787 --> 07:35.246
I'm stronger than you.

07:35.497 --> 07:38.749
Hm? Oh yeah?

07:38.750 --> 07:41.252
<i>Master! Keep your cool!</i>

07:43.171 --> 07:48.009
Warden, you sure I can just walk
right out the front door?

07:48.259 --> 07:50.929
This is an extra-legal measure.

07:51.304 --> 07:52.471
Let me remind you that

07:52.472 --> 07:56.183
every time you've broken
out of prison to do hero work

07:56.184 --> 07:57.894
that's all been illegal activity.

07:58.937 --> 08:00.771
I don't like how
the Hero Association

08:00.772 --> 08:03.233
gives a guy like you
preferential treatment.

08:03.566 --> 08:05.443
But just this once,
I can't afford to say that.

08:06.736 --> 08:10.572
There was a single cat-like monster

08:10.573 --> 08:13.451
who turned some of the prisoners
into monsters and took them away.

08:13.910 --> 08:17.288
Many officers who fought back
lost their lives.

08:17.664 --> 08:19.791
You're a hero out there,
aren't you?

08:19.958 --> 08:21.751
Isn't that right,
boss of the prisoners?

08:22.460 --> 08:25.046
Get revenge for us!

08:25.880 --> 08:27.090
Leave it to me.

08:27.716 --> 08:31.093
I'll make them pay dearly

08:31.094 --> 08:33.096
for wrecking this place
while I was gone.

08:34.013 --> 08:35.640
Hang on, Boss!

08:36.224 --> 08:38.143
I knitted a sweater for you.

08:38.685 --> 08:39.978
Please wear it if you like.

08:44.149 --> 08:47.027
Thank you.
This will give me courage.

08:49.779 --> 08:50.655
Hey.

08:51.031 --> 08:52.907
You mind leaving the room?

08:53.033 --> 08:54.826
I can't focus with
you all staring at me.

08:57.704 --> 08:58.830
Metal Knight.

08:58.955 --> 09:01.708
I know you're pretending
not to be there. Please answer.

09:02.876 --> 09:03.960
<i>What...?</i>

09:04.169 --> 09:07.255
I feel like I'm wasting
a lot of time and effort.

09:09.049 --> 09:12.010
I'm sure you've figured out
where the hideout is by now, right?

09:12.177 --> 09:14.762
Please tell me.
We're running out of time.

09:14.763 --> 09:16.681
Are you going to
let the hostage die?

09:17.724 --> 09:21.061
<i>By not telling you,
the hostage might die.</i>

09:21.227 --> 09:22.561
<i>But if I do tell you</i>

09:22.562 --> 09:26.149
<i>I bring death to not only
the hostage, but to all of you.</i>

09:26.399 --> 09:30.445
<i>I will make a rational choice
based on justice.</i>

09:30.862 --> 09:32.780
There's another option.

09:32.781 --> 09:34.741
You can join the operation.

09:35.366 --> 09:37.702
What are you so afraid of?

09:37.911 --> 09:40.663
What is the state of
your machine body right now?

09:41.122 --> 09:44.542
If it has been destroyed, which
monster did that to you and how?

09:46.002 --> 09:47.921
<i>Monster King Orochi.</i>

09:48.880 --> 09:50.215
<i>It was just one strike.</i>

09:50.381 --> 09:52.174
<i>The arm I used to
guard myself was destroyed.</i>

09:52.175 --> 09:54.385
<i>Even the self-destruction device
was disabled.</i>

09:55.637 --> 09:58.640
<i>It's not the Monster Association
I'm afraid of...</i>

09:59.390 --> 10:00.224
<i>Evil powers are</i>

10:00.225 --> 10:02.602
<i>watching for their chance to
take over the world.</i>

10:03.019 --> 10:05.270
<i>When humanity's defenses
become weak</i>

10:05.271 --> 10:07.273
<i>they'll strike all at once
to take everything.</i>

10:07.690 --> 10:09.400
<i>Be careful.</i>

10:09.651 --> 10:12.153
<i>Don't trust anyone around you.</i>

10:12.612 --> 10:15.281
<i>If you want to enforce justice
do it alone.</i>

10:15.740 --> 10:17.866
<i>Build up your strength...</i>

10:17.867 --> 10:20.078
<i>And save it for the right time,
Child Emperor.</i>

10:25.834 --> 10:28.253
The Hero Association is useless.

10:28.461 --> 10:29.546
Listen up, all of you!

10:29.879 --> 10:31.171
Even as I speak

10:31.172 --> 10:33.550
my son is trembling in fear
as he waits for help.

10:33.967 --> 10:36.261
Head over to the abandoned area
of City Z immediately

10:36.386 --> 10:37.971
and find the Monsters' hideout!

10:38.138 --> 10:39.722
And rescue my son!

10:40.140 --> 10:41.932
The battle suits you are wearing

10:41.933 --> 10:44.102
are secret weapons
obtained from special channels.

10:44.519 --> 10:45.978
The performance of these suits

10:45.979 --> 10:48.857
easily surpass the power
of any professional hero.

10:49.065 --> 10:53.194
NARINKI PRIVATE FORCE

10:49.357 --> 10:51.109
Make full use of your battle suits

10:51.234 --> 10:53.236
and exterminate
every single monster you encounter.

10:53.945 --> 10:55.905
I'll pay whatever you name
for the success fee!

10:56.197 --> 10:57.865
Bring back Waganma alive

10:57.866 --> 10:59.909
and you will live in
luxury for generations to come!

11:00.034 --> 11:00.994
Go!!

11:06.958 --> 11:10.712
I'm pretty sure
it's that small building.

11:11.671 --> 11:12.922
I got you cornered!

11:15.758 --> 11:18.052
<i>The Blizzard Bunch
has been wiped out.</i>

11:18.344 --> 11:20.555
<i>Well, half of it
is my sister's fault.</i>

11:21.514 --> 11:22.932
<i>This is an emergency.</i>

11:23.391 --> 11:25.434
<i>I need to use this place
as a branch office</i>

11:25.435 --> 11:27.353
<i>of the Blizzard Bunch
to hold a meeting.</i>

11:28.146 --> 11:29.105
Yes?

11:29.480 --> 11:30.773
Saita...
Wait, who are you?

11:31.316 --> 11:33.359
Oh? A friend?

11:33.943 --> 11:36.321
You have a visitor, Saitama!

11:38.489 --> 11:40.992
Blizzard's here again.

11:41.159 --> 11:43.785
Hey, how come the monster I raised

11:43.786 --> 11:46.122
died right away
with just a single hit of yours?

11:46.497 --> 11:48.291
What do you want, Hellish Blizzard?

11:48.541 --> 11:50.501
Master is not
taking any new disciples.

11:50.627 --> 11:52.128
Sorry, it's so cramped.

11:52.253 --> 11:54.839
Would you hand me that poultice?

11:55.131 --> 11:57.342
Why would wind be earth's weakness?

11:57.467 --> 11:59.928
But I'm at level 27
and you're at level 15, you know.

12:00.178 --> 12:01.595
Even if you're at
the highest level

12:01.596 --> 12:04.224
Old Man Golem can't beat
Meow-Meow types.

12:04.641 --> 12:06.142
It's a weak character
to begin with.

12:06.351 --> 12:08.393
What? You should've
told me that sooner!

12:08.394 --> 12:10.605
- This Armpit character...
- That one's weak too.

12:10.730 --> 12:13.233
Actually, only the cute characters
are strong.

12:13.358 --> 12:15.526
Oh, forget it.
That just ruined it for me.

12:16.027 --> 12:17.320
<i>What is going on?</i>

12:18.196 --> 12:19.822
Hm? Why are you here?

12:19.948 --> 12:21.157
It's an emergency.

12:21.366 --> 12:23.409
The Blizzard Bunch got wiped out!

12:23.576 --> 12:25.787
The Monster Organization is
extremely dangerous.

12:26.037 --> 12:27.996
This is no time
to be playing games.

12:27.997 --> 12:30.416
Do you have any idea
what's going on right now?

12:31.125 --> 12:32.669
You don't need to yell.

12:33.044 --> 12:35.963
I just got home a while ago and
was taking a short break.

12:35.964 --> 12:37.340
Don't lie down!

12:37.548 --> 12:41.386
Just like Master said, we were
also facing some tough opponents.

12:41.803 --> 12:43.429
Don't think you guys
were the only ones.

12:43.638 --> 12:46.933
Yeah, I can tell
from the way you look.

12:47.725 --> 12:49.643
I know King was here before

12:49.644 --> 12:52.647
but what's Silverfang
doing here now?

12:53.231 --> 12:58.278
I fought alongside them,
so Saitama is letting me rest here.

12:58.569 --> 13:00.237
I got a little carried away

13:00.238 --> 13:02.365
threw my back out,
and now I can't move.

13:02.573 --> 13:04.033
My knees gave out.

13:04.242 --> 13:07.370
Using Fist of Roaring Qi, Rending Air
after so long took its toll.

13:07.912 --> 13:10.957
I see, it must have been
quite a battle.

13:11.457 --> 13:15.128
<i>Yet why?
Why is this guy the same as usual?</i>

13:15.503 --> 13:17.671
Hey Saitama!
You're acting all cool and calm

13:17.672 --> 13:19.298
but you're actually panicking, right?

13:19.299 --> 13:21.217
Not really...
it's just the same as usual.

13:21.551 --> 13:22.384
What?

13:22.385 --> 13:24.762
There's no way this situation
is the same as usual!

13:25.263 --> 13:26.889
Why is she getting mad?

13:27.348 --> 13:29.016
I hate to break it to you

13:29.017 --> 13:31.019
but this situation
is not the same as usual.

13:31.352 --> 13:32.312
BAM BAM

13:31.436 --> 13:32.729
Come sit!

13:33.104 --> 13:35.481
We're going to have
a strategy meeting right now!

13:34.397 --> 13:35.522
BAM BAM

13:35.523 --> 13:36.816
Seriously, why are you here?

13:37.150 --> 13:39.569
Genos! You're Class S.

13:39.736 --> 13:42.905
The Hero Association executives
haven't told you about their next moves?

13:45.033 --> 13:46.825
I was supporting
Master Saitama yesterday

13:46.826 --> 13:49.996
at a martial arts tournament
and also in a battle myself.

13:50.455 --> 13:52.497
Not to mention,
the transmitter for the Association

13:52.498 --> 13:54.207
got melted and was destroyed.

13:54.208 --> 13:57.378
I dropped mine
into a crack in the ground.

13:57.628 --> 13:59.713
I noticed mine was broken too.

13:59.714 --> 14:02.383
It might have been because of the
shockwaves from Saitama's punch.

14:02.633 --> 14:04.176
So what's our next move?

14:04.177 --> 14:06.679
We're on the brink of war
with the monsters.

14:06.971 --> 14:08.931
I need to undergo
some repairs first.

14:09.140 --> 14:11.017
Well, obviously.

14:11.267 --> 14:12.809
We're gonna need time to recover

14:12.810 --> 14:15.228
before we can
get back into action again.

14:15.229 --> 14:16.814
You can't beat age.

14:17.398 --> 14:18.231
What about you, King?

14:18.232 --> 14:21.069
I think there's some other business
I have to tend to...

14:21.486 --> 14:24.447
So Saitama and I are the only ones
who are ready to go.

14:25.239 --> 14:26.532
So what do you say?

14:26.783 --> 14:28.950
Headquarters probably
has its own special task force

14:28.951 --> 14:30.745
that's devising a plan.

14:31.287 --> 14:34.664
But at times like this, actions
taken by Class-B heroes and below

14:34.665 --> 14:36.834
can affect their future evaluation.

14:37.168 --> 14:39.252
So we should try to
do something to contribute.

14:39.253 --> 14:40.755
DAZE

14:39.796 --> 14:40.755
Are you listening?

14:41.464 --> 14:42.798
This time, the enemy is

14:42.799 --> 14:45.175
a large group of monsters
that usually act independently

14:45.176 --> 14:47.637
but they have formed an alliance
which is unusual.

14:48.513 --> 14:51.515
However, their organizational structure

14:51.516 --> 14:53.975
likely is more about domination
than cooperation

14:53.976 --> 14:56.270
with a boss giving orders.

14:56.521 --> 14:59.065
Right, a monster group.

14:59.524 --> 15:03.111
If Garou's joined up with them,
that's gonna be trouble.

15:03.277 --> 15:07.949
Yeah, we may never get another
chance to fight Garou alone.

15:08.116 --> 15:09.699
If they still have any monsters

15:09.700 --> 15:12.452
as strong as that centipede
on their side

15:12.453 --> 15:13.412
it's not looking good.

15:13.538 --> 15:15.832
Might as well quit
being a hero, Bang.

15:16.165 --> 15:17.125
Saitama.

15:17.375 --> 15:19.668
Looks like the Hero Hunter
you've been wanting to meet

15:19.669 --> 15:20.753
was at that scene.

15:20.920 --> 15:22.672
You just missed him.

15:23.131 --> 15:26.968
On my way home, I heard that
he hunted down more heroes.

15:29.345 --> 15:30.346
That's unforgivable.

15:30.596 --> 15:33.224
Especially since
he hasn't come for me yet.

15:33.391 --> 15:34.767
Is it because I'm the Caped Baldy?

15:36.185 --> 15:37.770
- Saitama?
- Master?

15:37.895 --> 15:38.980
I'm going out for a bit.

15:39.897 --> 15:41.607
Do you know where Garou is?

15:41.983 --> 15:43.109
I'm gonna look for him.

15:43.985 --> 15:46.529
When I find Garou, I'll punch him.

15:48.156 --> 15:49.866
I'll also buy
napa cabbage on the way back.

15:53.661 --> 15:56.831
<i>Here I was calling the shots,
but I'm left out in the cold again...</i>

15:57.415 --> 15:59.457
<i>Trying to get Saitama
and his crew</i>

15:59.458 --> 16:01.419
<i>to join the Blizzard Bunch
will not be easy.</i>

16:14.515 --> 16:17.518
<i>Where am I?
Did I survive?</i>

16:17.768 --> 16:19.228
<i>My memory is a bit fuzzy.</i>

16:20.438 --> 16:22.481
<i>Welcome to the Monster Association.</i>

16:22.857 --> 16:26.819
<i>The fact that you are reading this
means you survived.</i>

16:27.445 --> 16:31.240
<i>Be aware that we are the ones
who saved your life.</i>

16:31.449 --> 16:35.244
<i>So wait quietly in this room
without causing any trouble.</i>

16:35.578 --> 16:38.789
<i>Going outside right now will only
make you a target for heroes.</i>

16:39.081 --> 16:40.917
<i>What you need is a place to belong.</i>

16:41.083 --> 16:44.212
<i>There's a change of clothes.
Please feel free to use them.</i>

16:46.214 --> 16:50.092
<i>Oww... It hurts like hell!!
My whole body!</i>

16:50.593 --> 16:53.720
<i>I'm thirsty. And I need food...</i>

16:53.721 --> 16:55.681
<i>...to replenish my blood.</i>

16:58.684 --> 17:03.314
<i>I was fighting the old man,
then that bird guy appeared...</i>

17:03.773 --> 17:06.150
<i>The Monster Association...
They get on my nerves.</i>

17:06.984 --> 17:08.319
<i>What happened to the old man?</i>

17:08.694 --> 17:10.279
<i>He was fighting that centipede...</i>

17:11.197 --> 17:12.281
<i>Oh well, who cares...</i>

17:13.032 --> 17:16.035
<i>The smell of blood permeates
the stagnant air.</i>

17:16.410 --> 17:17.370
<i>Makes me wanna puke.</i>

17:17.828 --> 17:20.373
<i>And it's so quiet,
my ears are ringing.</i>

17:20.665 --> 17:22.499
<i>Am I deep underground?</i>

17:22.500 --> 17:23.584
<i>Who cares...</i>

17:26.796 --> 17:29.214
Please have mercy!
We were wrong!

17:29.215 --> 17:31.676
We'll never defy you ever again!

17:31.801 --> 17:34.094
Noo, I don't want to die!

17:34.095 --> 17:38.557
But you took out
two of my soldiers.

17:38.558 --> 17:41.227
I can't just let you
walk out of here.

17:41.644 --> 17:45.397
Your employer equipped you
with powerful gear

17:45.398 --> 17:47.191
so you'd better fight till the end.

17:47.483 --> 17:52.321
Everyone here just loves turning anyone
who resists into a plaything.

17:52.780 --> 17:55.449
Grr...
It's all his fault.

17:55.700 --> 17:58.618
Dammit. If that freak robot
hadn't shown up

17:58.619 --> 18:00.329
we could've escaped to the surface.

18:00.580 --> 18:02.498
Looks like the advertising worked.

18:02.748 --> 18:04.333
Thanks for the gift.

18:04.458 --> 18:07.460
I'm glad a capable
new recruit came to us.

18:07.461 --> 18:09.338
You pass with flying colors.

18:09.505 --> 18:11.882
What is your name, newbie?

18:12.383 --> 18:14.176
I am Machine God G5.

18:12.800 --> 18:18.681
THREAT LEVEL: DEMON
MACHINE GOD G5

18:14.594 --> 18:18.681
I was deployed by the organization
to aid the Monster Association.

18:18.889 --> 18:20.016
"Organization"?

18:20.224 --> 18:22.934
How did you get to this hideout
without getting lost?

18:22.935 --> 18:24.687
Can I talk to your creator?

18:25.896 --> 18:27.772
So be it.
In any case, we welcome you.

18:27.773 --> 18:29.400
Besides,
we have another arrival anyway.

18:29.775 --> 18:32.903
<i>Stay hidden
and wait a little longer, Garou.</i>

18:33.738 --> 18:36.949
<i>A voice directly in my head!
Is it telepathy?</i>

18:37.074 --> 18:40.744
Having fought them myself,
I can say that

18:40.745 --> 18:44.122
their battle suits have
extremely high combat capabilities

18:44.123 --> 18:45.666
and are highly valuable.

18:46.250 --> 18:49.253
However, they appear to be
customized for each individual.

18:49.462 --> 18:53.382
So no one else, let alone a monster,
would be able to use them.

18:53.799 --> 18:57.553
In other words, we should let them
live and use them as pawns.

18:59.138 --> 19:02.808
Then, you're mine.
I'll train you well.

19:04.393 --> 19:05.852
Train?
What on earth?

19:05.853 --> 19:07.396
Please just let us go!

19:08.105 --> 19:09.148
Quiet!

19:15.404 --> 19:21.077
Excellent! I'm lucky to
have such promising slaves!

19:31.379 --> 19:34.005
Hey, Garou. You're up early.

19:34.006 --> 19:35.882
- So that's the Hero Hunter.
- He got rescued...

19:35.883 --> 19:37.759
- I like him.
- ...and treated for his injuries.

19:37.760 --> 19:40.762
Why did Gyoro-Gyoro
take interest in a mere human?

19:40.763 --> 19:43.015
- Is he human? A monster?
- Silence!

19:43.391 --> 19:45.643
I'm going to have an important talk
with him now.

19:46.143 --> 19:48.354
<i>What the heck is that giant
in the back?</i>

19:49.230 --> 19:50.815
What do you want me to do?

19:51.148 --> 19:55.026
After the recent battle,
there are fewer than 30 remaining

19:55.027 --> 19:57.697
threat-level Demon or higher
monsters left.

19:58.197 --> 20:00.950
Even so,
we are still strong enough to win.

20:01.325 --> 20:05.830
But what we lack right now
is unity... and a leader.

20:06.414 --> 20:10.167
I'd like you to become a member
of the leadership and assist me.

20:10.668 --> 20:12.169
A leader already?

20:12.294 --> 20:13.587
That's a pretty sweet deal.

20:14.046 --> 20:15.463
I was looking for someone

20:15.464 --> 20:20.094
with a strong anti-hero ideology
like him.

20:20.511 --> 20:23.680
He's a lone wolf,
but even if he is battered

20:23.681 --> 20:26.808
the way he goes for the jugular
against Class-S heroes

20:26.809 --> 20:28.018
is truly praiseworthy.

20:29.353 --> 20:32.773
However, our boss, Lord Orochi,
has one condition.

20:33.315 --> 20:36.986
Prove that you are a true monster.

20:37.153 --> 20:38.695
You want me to grow a horn?

20:38.696 --> 20:40.322
You have one day.

20:40.614 --> 20:43.826
I don't care who it is.
Bring me the head of a hero.

20:44.410 --> 20:45.828
If it's a hero's life you want...

20:46.036 --> 20:47.704
Hate to give you the bad news

20:47.705 --> 20:50.082
but Silverfang and his buddies
are alive.

20:50.207 --> 20:52.126
Centichoro was defeated.

20:56.547 --> 21:00.259
Sorry to bother you.
I have a favor to ask you.

21:00.426 --> 21:02.511
Hmph, what do you want?

21:01.135 --> 21:02.511
THREAT LEVEL: DEMON
INSECT GOD

21:02.678 --> 21:04.889
I want so badly to hear
a human scream.

21:03.304 --> 21:08.392
THREAT LEVEL: DEMON
KING THE RIPPER

21:05.014 --> 21:08.267
I'm about to lose my mind.
Hurry up.

21:08.642 --> 21:10.436
Garou went outside.

21:11.437 --> 21:12.605
Follow him.

22:45.906 --> 22:47.657
Yesterday, it was Goketsu.

22:47.658 --> 22:50.160
And today, Centichoro was defeated.

22:50.369 --> 22:53.496
Yeah, I bet even Gyoro-Gyoro
didn't expect two top monsters

22:53.497 --> 22:55.499
to go down
before the decisive battle.

22:55.624 --> 22:58.001
Is that why he's trying to recruit
the Hero Hunter?

22:58.002 --> 22:59.628
So he can be
one of the key warriors?

22:59.837 --> 23:01.964
I can't read Gyoro-Gyoro.

23:02.131 --> 23:04.216
Not like I'm interested
or anything.

23:04.550 --> 23:06.718
As long as I can destroy
the Hero Association and Flash

23:06.719 --> 23:07.553
I'm all good.

23:08.095 --> 23:09.095
We recruited

23:09.096 --> 23:11.348
Speed-o'-Sound Sonic
but what happened to him?

23:11.682 --> 23:12.975
I haven't seen him around.

23:13.183 --> 23:15.394
Maybe he couldn't adapt
to the monster cells.

23:19.690 --> 23:23.444
I suffered all night,
but I think the worst is over.

23:23.986 --> 23:26.154
I hate those bastards from
the Monster Association.

23:26.155 --> 23:28.490
No one told me my stomach
would get this upset.

23:28.657 --> 23:30.075
I'll pay 'em back for this one day.

23:32.244 --> 23:33.203
Whatever.

23:33.579 --> 23:36.497
I never had any intention of
teaming up with the monsters.

23:36.498 --> 23:39.083
I just wanted to
take advantage of them.

23:39.084 --> 23:41.754
My only target is Saitama.

23:42.171 --> 23:43.338
That being said...

23:43.339 --> 23:45.883
I can feel it... a new power.

23:46.467 --> 23:49.178
My body is definitely changing.

23:49.553 --> 23:51.429
My body feels light.

23:51.430 --> 23:54.058
It may take a while
to get used to it.

23:54.516 --> 23:56.143
<i>So this is monsterization?</i>

23:56.268 --> 23:58.854
<i>Not that it's anything special.</i>

23:59.897 --> 24:04.817
SONIC LOST TWO KILOGRAMS

24:04.818 --> 24:09.740
MONSTER TRAITS
