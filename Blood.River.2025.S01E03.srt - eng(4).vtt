[Blood River]

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:33.980
[Based on the novel of the same name from Zhou Munan's Youth in Jianghu series]

[Available on fanqienovel.com & bkneng.com]

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:38.980
[Episode 3]

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:49.980
This is the first

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:51.540
of those three hidden weapons,

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:53.820
Cries of 1,000 Birds!

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:19.340
Yu.

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:22.660
What are you up to again?

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:28.570
Do you truly intend to kill me?

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:30.570
The same bewitching spell

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:31.940
won't work

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:32.820
on me again.

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:34.780
Tell me the motive

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:35.660
of your Patriarch,

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:37.010
and I'll spare you.

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:38.410
I told you before.

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:40.100
I don't know any bewitching spells.

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:45.340
If you actually had feelings for me,

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:51.290
that means you've fallen for me.

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:58.130
Demoness,

00:02:58.870 --> 00:02:59.500
do not spout such nonsense!

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:00.570
Wait!

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:03.820
Can you use another hidden weapon instead?

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:05.010
What do you mean?

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:07.570
I'll be pricked by all these needles.

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:09.260
I'll meet an ugly end, you know?

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:12.570
Can you use something else

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:15.220
that won't let me meet an ugly end?

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:16.130
Or use something

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:18.450
that can let me die while preserving my looks?

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:26.780
What is this?

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:28.380
This is the Blood Rose.

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:29.570
Although

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:30.660
it might look silver to you,

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:32.130
once it penetrates

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:33.130
your body,

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:35.380
your blood will flow into its petals,

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:37.290
dyeing it red.

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:38.690
It'll form a beautiful rose.

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:56.010
So, you're the leader of the Blood River Spider Shadow Sect,

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:56.890
Kui.

00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:58.100
How's your injury?

00:03:58.630 --> 00:03:59.890
I would've died for real

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:01.380
had you come a few moments later.

00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:02.890
Trap him with the 1000-Spider Array.

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:12.850
I suppose I have to see

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:13.850
the rest of your hidden weapons next time.

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:22.100
Yu,

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:24.140
the Tracking Spider that you owned

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:25.220
started getting excited all of a sudden.

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:27.100
I knew that you would be near.

00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:28.410
Luckily, you made it in time.

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:29.410
Is your injury okay?

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:31.100
It's nothing too serious.

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:33.170
Tang Lianyue

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:34.410
went easy on me.

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:35.490
If not,

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:37.490
I might've been dead.

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:38.850
After all,

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:41.460
he's one of the Four Guardians of Tianqi City.

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:43.460
He's a top martial arts expert.

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:47.490
Luckily, he's the one you encountered.

00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:50.850
Tang Lianyue, the Xuanwu Guardian,

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:53.370
always hated killing.

00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:55.050
Nonsense.

00:04:56.430 --> 00:04:57.490
He spared me

00:04:57.720 --> 00:04:58.730
because

00:04:58.750 --> 00:04:59.610
he fell for me at first glance.

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:02.290
Your blind confidence

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:03.540
is actually growing stronger.

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:06.580
I'm serious.

00:05:07.390 --> 00:05:08.810
Just now, he said

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:10.610
that I cast a bewitching spell on him.

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:11.730
Yu,

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:13.580
do you think I know any bewitching spells?

00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:16.250
Most of the women in the Mu family excel at bewitching spells.

00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:18.780
However, I suppose you don't know any.

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:23.610
The Xuanwu Guardian targeted me because he fell for me.

00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:25.660
I must be charming, then.

00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:27.410
Let's drop the topic for now.

00:05:28.390 --> 00:05:29.140
Changhe sent many people

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:30.410
to obstruct me while I was on my way here.

00:05:31.190 --> 00:05:31.980
He knew all about

00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:32.780
our movements.

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:34.660
He even delivered a message to Tang Lianyue.

00:05:35.510 --> 00:05:36.340
That means he has planted a mole

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:37.050
within Spider Shadow.

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:39.170
We have to return to the Patriarch

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:39.980
as soon as possible.

00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:41.930
Yu.

00:05:44.070 --> 00:05:45.580
Has it never occurred to you

00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:46.980
that I might be

00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:49.660
the mole?

00:05:51.950 --> 00:05:53.050
That's not funny.

00:05:54.070 --> 00:05:54.930
I'm not joking.

00:05:55.720 --> 00:05:56.810
I did hesitate before.

00:05:59.870 --> 00:06:00.540
Although

00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:02.900
I haven't managed

00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:04.290
to do something

00:06:04.310 --> 00:06:05.900
that will go against the vow I made back then,

00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:07.930
Yu,

00:06:09.950 --> 00:06:10.610
I hesitated.

00:06:12.310 --> 00:06:13.220
I'm starting to doubt

00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:15.220
the meaning of our existence.

00:06:19.190 --> 00:06:19.700
Yu.

00:06:20.510 --> 00:06:21.290
You grew up together

00:06:21.430 --> 00:06:22.700
with Changhe.

00:06:24.070 --> 00:06:24.980
But this time,

00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:28.050
do you two have to

00:06:28.070 --> 00:06:28.660
fight each other?

00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:32.140
I swore a vow when I joined Spider Shadow.

00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:34.460
I won't let anyone

00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:37.340
threaten the Patriarch's safety

00:06:37.430 --> 00:06:38.900
until the day I die.

00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:41.170
Of course I remember that.

00:06:42.630 --> 00:06:43.490
Joining the Spider Shadow

00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:46.290
is the biggest honor for a member of Blood River.

00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:48.730
Once the Patriarch's poison is neutralized,

00:06:50.040 --> 00:06:51.410
and he rules over the Three Families again,

00:06:52.430 --> 00:06:54.050
the head of the Su family will rescind his order.

00:06:55.360 --> 00:06:55.930
By then,

00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:57.730
we won't need to

00:06:57.800 --> 00:06:58.660
go against each other.

00:07:22.510 --> 00:07:23.610
Who's there?

00:07:24.360 --> 00:07:24.900
I'm Su Muyu

00:07:25.510 --> 00:07:26.140
of the Su family.

00:07:27.360 --> 00:07:28.410
Why are you here?

00:07:29.720 --> 00:07:30.290
I cannot

00:07:30.920 --> 00:07:31.730
accept this mission.

00:07:36.430 --> 00:07:37.290
It's been many years

00:07:37.310 --> 00:07:38.250
since anyone dared

00:07:38.720 --> 00:07:40.540
to reject the mission

00:07:40.560 --> 00:07:41.370
the Soul Reapers' Hall had assigned.

00:07:41.800 --> 00:07:42.610
Even the Patriarch

00:07:42.680 --> 00:07:44.340
cannot change our decision.

00:07:45.240 --> 00:07:45.780
What's your excuse

00:07:46.270 --> 00:07:47.730
for rejecting us?

00:07:48.390 --> 00:07:49.250
I don't feel like accepting it.

00:07:50.070 --> 00:07:51.610
That's not your decision to make.

00:07:52.630 --> 00:07:54.100
But I know why you're doing so.

00:07:54.630 --> 00:07:56.140
Zhang Taicheng, the Governor of Luonan,

00:07:56.750 --> 00:07:57.610
was rumored

00:07:57.680 --> 00:07:59.100
to be an excellent official who loved his people.

00:07:59.830 --> 00:08:00.980
When the south was struck by a flood,

00:08:01.120 --> 00:08:01.610
every prefecture

00:08:01.630 --> 00:08:02.980
lined their pockets.

00:08:03.680 --> 00:08:04.610
He was the only one who opened the granaries

00:08:04.920 --> 00:08:05.980
to aid the people.

00:08:06.430 --> 00:08:07.290
Not only that,

00:08:07.800 --> 00:08:09.020
but he also reported their corruption

00:08:09.040 --> 00:08:10.100
to Tianqi City,

00:08:10.190 --> 00:08:11.140
forcing Tianqi City

00:08:11.190 --> 00:08:12.220
to send their inspectors here.

00:08:12.800 --> 00:08:14.780
That's how the people were able to survive.

00:08:15.160 --> 00:08:16.220
He's a good person.

00:08:16.800 --> 00:08:17.250
Therefore,

00:08:18.070 --> 00:08:19.340
you don't wish to kill him.

00:08:20.310 --> 00:08:20.980
Such audacity!

00:08:22.190 --> 00:08:23.700
Once you receive the writ of the Soul Reapers' Hall,

00:08:24.390 --> 00:08:25.850
you have to kill your target, even if he's the emperor.

00:08:26.830 --> 00:08:28.100
Whether he's good or bad doesn't matter.

00:08:28.750 --> 00:08:29.580
You're an assassin.

00:08:29.950 --> 00:08:30.810
You aren't a saint.

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:32.730
I won't accept it.

00:08:40.150 --> 00:08:41.610
Relay a message to the head of the Su family.

00:08:42.030 --> 00:08:43.010
Deem him a traitor.

00:08:43.670 --> 00:08:44.340
Kill him.

00:08:45.030 --> 00:08:46.130
Kill him!

00:08:46.960 --> 00:08:48.340
If the old fool of the Su family isn't willing to kill him,

00:08:49.200 --> 00:08:49.650
I'll do it.

00:08:50.150 --> 00:08:51.490
Calm down.

00:08:51.750 --> 00:08:52.180
Look.

00:08:52.870 --> 00:08:54.650
One of his friends has arrived.

00:08:58.960 --> 00:08:59.890
Greetings, Three Officials.

00:09:00.320 --> 00:09:01.580
Su Changhe,

00:09:02.320 --> 00:09:03.770
also known as the Undertaker.

00:09:04.360 --> 00:09:06.060
The rising prodigy of the Su family.

00:09:06.790 --> 00:09:08.300
You stand shoulder to shoulder with Su Muyu.

00:09:08.510 --> 00:09:09.300
Shoulder to shoulder?

00:09:11.030 --> 00:09:12.650
That means I'm inferior to him.

00:09:13.840 --> 00:09:15.220
What are you doing here?

00:09:15.600 --> 00:09:16.980
Su Muyu is a great buddy of mine.

00:09:17.790 --> 00:09:18.940
He wanted to set a rule

00:09:19.240 --> 00:09:20.610
for the Soul Reapers' Hall about how he would accept missions.

00:09:21.630 --> 00:09:23.370
My buddy has a set of rules called the Three Refusals.

00:09:24.200 --> 00:09:25.460
He refuses to accept missions of massacre,

00:09:26.320 --> 00:09:27.580
missions without cause,

00:09:28.200 --> 00:09:29.460
and missions against his will.

00:09:32.390 --> 00:09:33.580
And I, Su Changhe,

00:09:34.440 --> 00:09:35.730
wish to set a rule too.

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:38.650
You two

00:09:38.670 --> 00:09:40.250
are still green.

00:09:40.840 --> 00:09:42.890
You think you can set up a rule here?

00:09:44.200 --> 00:09:46.340
Even the Patriarch doesn't have the right to do so.

00:09:47.870 --> 00:09:48.650
It seems

00:09:49.120 --> 00:09:50.340
the Soul Reapers' Hall

00:09:51.150 --> 00:09:53.130
must keep you guys in check today.

00:09:55.600 --> 00:09:56.650
The other two officials, please wait.

00:09:57.510 --> 00:09:58.940
I wish to hear about

00:09:59.550 --> 00:10:00.370
the kind of rule

00:10:01.150 --> 00:10:02.340
you wish to set.

00:10:03.150 --> 00:10:04.460
This is the rule I wish to set.

00:10:05.360 --> 00:10:07.300
For the missions that Su Muyu wouldn't accept,

00:10:08.150 --> 00:10:09.060
I'll accept them all.

00:10:24.600 --> 00:10:26.130
You went to the Soul Reapers' Hall a few days ago.

00:10:28.390 --> 00:10:29.100
Why did you go there?

00:10:30.080 --> 00:10:31.610
Of course I went there to negotiate a deal on your behalf.

00:10:32.910 --> 00:10:33.980
You're bad with your words.

00:10:34.550 --> 00:10:36.100
The Soul Reapers' Hall isn't the Patriarch.

00:10:36.360 --> 00:10:37.250
They only acknowledge the rules.

00:10:37.960 --> 00:10:38.850
They don't care about the sword you wield.

00:10:40.360 --> 00:10:41.700
No wonder it's as if they've acknowledged

00:10:41.790 --> 00:10:42.730
the three rules I set.

00:10:43.720 --> 00:10:44.580
Naturally.

00:10:45.240 --> 00:10:47.010
I've always been eloquent, you know?

00:10:49.790 --> 00:10:51.300
If they don't yield, you'll beat them until they do.

00:10:51.840 --> 00:10:52.530
If that's the case,

00:10:53.240 --> 00:10:54.580
I suppose you're eloquent in your own way.

00:10:58.840 --> 00:10:59.490
Don't tell me

00:10:59.550 --> 00:11:00.180
you actually fought them.

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:02.770
I merely analyzed

00:11:02.910 --> 00:11:04.250
the pros and cons for them.

00:11:04.870 --> 00:11:06.580
The Soul Reapers' Hall keeps tabs too, you know?

00:11:06.910 --> 00:11:07.580
Killing you

00:11:07.750 --> 00:11:08.770
doesn't benefit them in any way.

00:11:13.750 --> 00:11:14.490
Be honest with me.

00:11:15.630 --> 00:11:16.610
Did you agree

00:11:16.670 --> 00:11:17.300
to some of their conditions?

00:11:20.080 --> 00:11:20.980
You have your own means.

00:11:21.080 --> 00:11:21.850
I have my own means as well.

00:11:24.600 --> 00:11:25.300
Just trust me.

00:11:31.620 --> 00:11:39.300
[Jiuxiao City]

00:11:41.780 --> 00:11:44.460
[Jiuxiao City]

00:11:45.360 --> 00:11:46.770
"My sword shatters the nine heavens,

00:11:46.770 --> 00:11:48.150
[Li Hanyi, Xueyue City]

00:11:48.150 --> 00:11:48.980
[Li Hanyi, Xueyue City]
severing all chaos.

00:11:48.980 --> 00:11:50.750
[Li Hanyi, Xueyue City]

00:11:50.750 --> 00:11:51.650
[Li Hanyi, Xueyue City]
It cuts through sorrow

00:12:09.030 --> 00:12:10.530
and strikes down every injustice,

00:12:11.320 --> 00:12:12.770
so that I can soar with you beyond the mortal sky."

00:12:12.960 --> 00:12:14.370
Is this the city

00:12:14.440 --> 00:12:15.850
where the Sword Poet Deity made a name for himself?

00:12:19.120 --> 00:12:21.130
His strike pierces through the nine heavens, huh?

00:12:21.720 --> 00:12:22.980
That's just a rumor.

00:12:26.630 --> 00:12:27.180
Sir.

00:12:28.080 --> 00:12:29.010
You're a swordsman too.

00:12:29.600 --> 00:12:30.770
Haven't you thought of visiting Jiuxiao City

00:12:31.080 --> 00:12:32.770
when you were young?

00:12:33.960 --> 00:12:35.420
Ordinary people see swords as mere swords.

00:12:36.240 --> 00:12:37.180
For Blood River, swords

00:12:38.120 --> 00:12:38.980
are weapons for murder.

00:12:40.670 --> 00:12:41.530
Moreover,

00:12:42.270 --> 00:12:43.130
I wasn't a swordsman

00:12:43.150 --> 00:12:44.010
when I was young.

00:12:45.150 --> 00:12:45.770
I picked up swordsmanship

00:12:46.440 --> 00:12:47.530
after that.

00:12:47.960 --> 00:12:48.580
Sir,

00:12:49.120 --> 00:12:50.250
what did people call you

00:12:50.480 --> 00:12:51.010
when you were young?

00:12:56.120 --> 00:12:57.010
Do you know

00:12:57.480 --> 00:12:59.100
that the question you asked just now

00:12:59.150 --> 00:13:01.180
was a taboo in Blood River?

00:13:08.320 --> 00:13:08.980
However,

00:13:10.030 --> 00:13:11.940
I think it won't matter even if I tell you my name.

00:13:12.910 --> 00:13:13.530
My surname is Mu.

00:13:14.480 --> 00:13:16.010
They called me Mu Mingce

00:13:17.030 --> 00:13:18.250
before I became the Patriarch.

00:13:20.240 --> 00:13:22.300
Mu Mingce?

00:13:29.630 --> 00:13:32.650
Is this the so-called Spider's Nest?

00:13:34.750 --> 00:13:35.650
The Spider Shadow Sect

00:13:35.790 --> 00:13:37.220
has set up such bases

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:39.580
in both Beili and Nanjue.

00:13:40.240 --> 00:13:40.940
Each base

00:13:41.670 --> 00:13:43.890
is a fortress that's easy to defend and hard to invade.

00:13:45.240 --> 00:13:46.530
Therefore, many people

00:13:48.630 --> 00:13:49.610
don't want us

00:13:50.390 --> 00:13:52.460
to return to our nest.

00:14:15.240 --> 00:14:16.340
That's all you got, huh?

00:14:17.080 --> 00:14:18.460
You think that you can deal with me?

00:14:18.720 --> 00:14:19.650
It's from the Xie family.

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:20.530
Chou the Ox,

00:14:21.390 --> 00:14:22.220
there's no need to expose them.

00:14:22.910 --> 00:14:23.460
Sir,

00:14:23.790 --> 00:14:25.010
since they were bold enough to attack us,

00:14:25.510 --> 00:14:26.100
there's no need

00:14:26.120 --> 00:14:27.340
for us to spare them.

00:14:27.630 --> 00:14:28.420
Let's kill them all.

00:14:34.120 --> 00:14:35.610
The Xie family and the Mu family actually joined hands?

00:14:56.550 --> 00:14:58.460
They actually set up the Heavenly Web Array!

00:15:01.440 --> 00:15:02.010
Heavenly Web Array?

00:15:03.440 --> 00:15:03.850
Don't look!

00:15:08.480 --> 00:15:08.890
Hai the Swine!

00:15:09.240 --> 00:15:09.700
Chou the Ox?

00:15:10.480 --> 00:15:11.130
I'm not dead yet.

00:15:11.870 --> 00:15:12.370
Sir,

00:15:12.750 --> 00:15:13.460
didn't you say

00:15:13.480 --> 00:15:14.890
that this carriage was impenetrable?

00:15:15.200 --> 00:15:15.820
Why aren't we using it?

00:15:16.270 --> 00:15:17.100
It's too late.

00:15:18.080 --> 00:15:19.220
He has already infiltrated it.

00:15:19.600 --> 00:15:20.180
He?

00:15:24.600 --> 00:15:26.460
Fanhua, it's you.

00:15:26.820 --> 00:15:29.030
[Xie Fanhua, young master of the Xie family]

00:15:29.030 --> 00:15:30.420
[Xie Fanhua, young master of the Xie family]
Long time no see.

00:15:31.240 --> 00:15:32.340
Sir,

00:15:33.030 --> 00:15:34.820
please pardon me for not being able to greet you

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:37.530
as I'm quite sick.

00:15:39.240 --> 00:15:40.250
Sickly Ghost?

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:42.700
You're terminally ill.

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:43.770
Even the deities can't save you.

00:15:44.750 --> 00:15:45.370
Indeed.

00:15:47.150 --> 00:15:49.340
I'm destined to die soon.

00:15:49.960 --> 00:15:51.130
That's why I'm daring enough

00:15:51.240 --> 00:15:53.940
to intercept the Patriarch's carriage and see him personally.

00:15:54.670 --> 00:15:55.850
I'm not afraid of

00:15:56.600 --> 00:15:57.460
the punishment that awaits me.

00:15:59.840 --> 00:16:00.890
So,

00:16:02.750 --> 00:16:04.580
what are you trying to tell me here?

00:16:06.910 --> 00:16:07.610
Sir,

00:16:08.480 --> 00:16:09.610
you've been in this position

00:16:10.440 --> 00:16:11.530
for a long time.

00:16:13.440 --> 00:16:14.180
And now,

00:16:14.550 --> 00:16:15.770
you're seriously wounded.

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:18.340
Why don't you use this opportunity to retire

00:16:18.750 --> 00:16:19.850
and enjoy the rest of your years?

00:16:20.080 --> 00:16:22.980
Isn't it better to leave this vexing position

00:16:23.510 --> 00:16:25.850
to those who are in the prime

00:16:26.550 --> 00:16:27.700
of their youth?

00:16:30.750 --> 00:16:32.130
In the prime of their youth?

00:16:32.750 --> 00:16:33.580
Are you referring

00:16:34.630 --> 00:16:35.490
to Xie Ba?

00:16:39.670 --> 00:16:41.300
The head of the Xie family

00:16:42.550 --> 00:16:43.370
has served Blood River faithfully

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:46.060
all these years.

00:16:47.550 --> 00:16:48.130
Naturally,

00:16:48.480 --> 00:16:50.100
he's the best candidate for the position.

00:16:52.440 --> 00:16:54.730
What if I reject your request?

00:16:57.270 --> 00:16:58.300
If so,

00:16:59.200 --> 00:17:00.580
I have no choice but to offend you.

00:17:17.310 --> 00:17:18.420
You guys merely

00:17:19.350 --> 00:17:20.220
desire

00:17:20.350 --> 00:17:21.180
the Dormant Dragon Sword

00:17:21.240 --> 00:17:22.380
that I possess.

00:17:24.480 --> 00:17:26.010
The one who wields the Dormant Dragon Sword

00:17:27.270 --> 00:17:29.490
is the true leader of Blood River.

00:17:30.240 --> 00:17:31.620
So, you know about that, huh?

00:17:32.590 --> 00:17:34.090
If so, I suppose you can see

00:17:34.680 --> 00:17:35.330
who the current wielder

00:17:35.400 --> 00:17:37.220
of the sword is.

00:17:41.240 --> 00:17:42.380
Since I still wield

00:17:42.680 --> 00:17:43.770
the sword,

00:17:44.920 --> 00:17:46.330
I'm still the leader

00:17:47.640 --> 00:17:49.090
of Blood River.

00:17:59.920 --> 00:18:00.620
The Soul-Calling Incense?

00:18:03.270 --> 00:18:03.730
Senior Brother!

00:18:07.310 --> 00:18:07.700
This is bad.

00:18:08.310 --> 00:18:09.860
He protected the incense with his inner force.

00:18:13.160 --> 00:18:13.620
Sir!

00:18:14.160 --> 00:18:14.900
The Patriarch is fine.

00:18:20.590 --> 00:18:21.180
Let's leave.

00:18:26.480 --> 00:18:27.770
It's impossible for Xie Fanhua

00:18:28.400 --> 00:18:29.980
to get his hands on the Soul-Calling Incense.

00:18:31.790 --> 00:18:33.420
The Mu family must've given it to him.

00:18:36.200 --> 00:18:37.180
The Soul-Calling Incense

00:18:37.350 --> 00:18:38.420
isn't that difficult to neutralize.

00:18:39.510 --> 00:18:40.490
But this is truly unexpected.

00:18:40.720 --> 00:18:42.250
Sir, you came from the Mu family.

00:18:43.200 --> 00:18:44.050
But now,

00:18:44.510 --> 00:18:46.490
even the Mu family is disregarding their past ties with you.

00:18:47.720 --> 00:18:48.810
Once a person becomes the Patriarch,

00:18:50.400 --> 00:18:52.220
they will cease to be a member of the Three Families.

00:19:01.350 --> 00:19:01.980
Sir,

00:19:02.590 --> 00:19:03.330
I never expected

00:19:03.400 --> 00:19:04.460
your inner force to be this powerful.

00:19:04.720 --> 00:19:06.250
You actually expelled the poison

00:19:06.310 --> 00:19:06.900
by force.

00:19:07.270 --> 00:19:08.330
That's the easy part.

00:19:09.070 --> 00:19:10.940
However, I can't utilize my power

00:19:12.160 --> 00:19:14.290
for the next 24 hours.

00:19:36.620 --> 00:19:39.070
[Mu Kewen, Spider's Nest]

00:19:39.070 --> 00:19:40.180
[Mu Kewen, Spider's Nest]
Sir.

00:19:43.070 --> 00:19:43.700
Ke.

00:19:45.240 --> 00:19:46.180
How long

00:19:46.960 --> 00:19:47.660
have you served the sect?

00:19:48.920 --> 00:19:50.460
It's been 30 years.

00:19:51.640 --> 00:19:53.140
I never thought I'd live to see the day

00:19:53.510 --> 00:19:55.530
when the Patriarch himself would come.

00:19:57.070 --> 00:19:58.380
I have no regrets in life now.

00:20:01.880 --> 00:20:04.330
You should've spent your retirement years here in peace.

00:20:05.680 --> 00:20:06.570
I've caused trouble for you

00:20:07.680 --> 00:20:08.860
by coming here.

00:20:09.400 --> 00:20:10.290
Sorry for bothering you.

00:20:11.350 --> 00:20:12.860
Sir, you must be joking.

00:20:13.480 --> 00:20:14.940
People like us

00:20:15.550 --> 00:20:17.140
have no right

00:20:17.480 --> 00:20:19.010
to retire.

00:20:20.880 --> 00:20:21.860
All of you, listen up.

00:20:22.550 --> 00:20:24.050
Utter no word the moment

00:20:25.160 --> 00:20:26.010
you step through the gate.

00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:29.490
Understood.

00:20:30.750 --> 00:20:31.620
Sir,

00:20:32.440 --> 00:20:33.180
the key.

00:22:22.680 --> 00:22:23.810
You all may speak now.

00:22:24.720 --> 00:22:26.010
Is that the Soundless Array?

00:22:26.400 --> 00:22:26.980
Indeed.

00:22:27.590 --> 00:22:30.250
That's the Soundless Array.

00:23:04.550 --> 00:23:05.220
Sir,

00:23:05.680 --> 00:23:07.460
let me take you to your room.

00:23:16.480 --> 00:23:17.140
Sir,

00:23:18.400 --> 00:23:19.660
who's this lady?

00:23:21.110 --> 00:23:22.180
I'm Bai Hehuai.

00:23:22.680 --> 00:23:23.940
I could've treated your hunched back

00:23:24.310 --> 00:23:25.460
had you encountered me 50 years earlier.

00:23:27.640 --> 00:23:28.250
This lady

00:23:28.270 --> 00:23:29.460
is the miracle physician of the Medicine King Valley.

00:23:30.400 --> 00:23:31.050
She might not be bragging

00:23:31.440 --> 00:23:32.620
with what she said.

00:23:33.270 --> 00:23:34.490
I never brag.

00:23:34.880 --> 00:23:35.810
He wasn't born

00:23:36.070 --> 00:23:36.810
with a hunched back.

00:23:37.110 --> 00:23:38.860
It was because someone poisoned him.

00:23:39.640 --> 00:23:40.810
His bones turned soft because of it.

00:23:40.960 --> 00:23:41.730
That's why his back is hunched.

00:23:44.750 --> 00:23:46.250
If the poison was neutralized in time,

00:23:46.590 --> 00:23:48.220
and if he received some chiropractic treatments,

00:23:48.440 --> 00:23:49.180
his condition could've been cured.

00:23:52.160 --> 00:23:53.010
It's a shame

00:23:54.400 --> 00:23:56.290
that it's been too long since then.

00:23:59.200 --> 00:24:00.090
Thank you, miracle physician.

00:24:00.920 --> 00:24:01.570
I'm already

00:24:02.070 --> 00:24:03.250
used to it.

00:24:04.400 --> 00:24:05.180
It's not that I cannot cure your condition.

00:24:05.510 --> 00:24:06.420
But the price

00:24:08.110 --> 00:24:08.700
will be steep.

00:24:09.480 --> 00:24:10.010
How steep?

00:24:16.070 --> 00:24:17.330
Why don't you give me the entire residence?

00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:21.730
Sir,

00:24:22.270 --> 00:24:24.140
the miracle physician must be joking.

00:24:27.110 --> 00:24:27.900
Miracle physician,

00:24:28.270 --> 00:24:29.980
you're quite greedy, aren't you?

00:24:30.790 --> 00:24:32.140
That's why I left the Medicine King Valley.

00:24:33.440 --> 00:24:34.050
Sir,

00:24:34.750 --> 00:24:36.490
we've arrived at your room.

00:24:36.880 --> 00:24:37.420
Miracle physician,

00:24:38.200 --> 00:24:39.770
if you encounter any issues,

00:24:40.590 --> 00:24:43.050
just tug this rope.

00:24:43.880 --> 00:24:46.570
The wooden bird will relay the sound through vibration.

00:24:47.480 --> 00:24:48.050
And,

00:24:48.920 --> 00:24:50.330
I'll rush to your side

00:24:50.510 --> 00:24:51.490
as fast as I can.

00:24:52.160 --> 00:24:52.700
The wooden bird?

00:24:53.270 --> 00:24:53.660
That's right.

00:24:54.480 --> 00:24:55.420
Wooden birds can be found

00:24:56.030 --> 00:24:58.420
in every corner of the Spider's Nest.

00:24:59.350 --> 00:25:00.010
Sir,

00:25:01.160 --> 00:25:02.220
I shall take my leave first.

00:25:39.270 --> 00:25:39.810
Sir.

00:25:47.750 --> 00:25:49.220
You're a stubborn old man.

00:25:50.270 --> 00:25:51.420
I haven't fainted yet.

00:25:52.750 --> 00:25:55.380
Miracle physician, you don't need to mock me first.

00:25:56.110 --> 00:25:57.010
I just think

00:25:57.240 --> 00:25:58.530
that the old man

00:25:58.590 --> 00:25:59.570
was loyal to you.

00:26:00.240 --> 00:26:01.530
If so, why did you still pretend

00:26:01.590 --> 00:26:02.290
to be tough

00:26:02.510 --> 00:26:03.420
and acted as if

00:26:03.440 --> 00:26:04.570
you were still normal?

00:26:04.680 --> 00:26:06.660
You would understand why

00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:09.090
if you saw the face he had when he killed people.

00:26:11.350 --> 00:26:12.660
I do trust him.

00:26:13.720 --> 00:26:14.570
But it's been 30 years

00:26:15.880 --> 00:26:17.900
since we met after all.

00:26:19.440 --> 00:26:20.290
It's truly exhausting

00:26:20.590 --> 00:26:21.180
to be the Patriarch.

00:26:48.510 --> 00:26:49.050
He's on our tails.

00:26:52.350 --> 00:26:53.010
I'll stop him.

00:26:53.350 --> 00:26:54.050
You can head to Jiuxiao City.

00:26:54.590 --> 00:26:55.380
We're talking about Tang Lianyue here.

00:26:56.160 --> 00:26:56.940
He might have spared you last time.

00:26:57.590 --> 00:26:58.420
But he might not this time.

00:26:59.550 --> 00:26:59.980
Yu,

00:27:00.640 --> 00:27:01.090
I don't want to choose

00:27:01.200 --> 00:27:02.380
between you and Changhe.

00:27:03.240 --> 00:27:04.180
Go and end this once and for all.

00:27:05.310 --> 00:27:06.420
You can decide for me.

00:27:08.830 --> 00:27:09.530
As for him...

00:27:10.960 --> 00:27:11.460
Just trust me.

00:27:12.200 --> 00:27:12.980
He can't bear to kill me.

00:27:18.160 --> 00:27:19.460
I'll give you some of my Life-Protecting zhenqi.

00:27:20.310 --> 00:27:21.090
Escape if you can't stop him.

00:27:31.160 --> 00:27:31.770
Please be careful.

00:27:45.960 --> 00:27:46.980
You're hot on our tails, aren't you?

00:27:47.440 --> 00:27:47.940
We've been traveling

00:27:47.960 --> 00:27:48.940
day and night without rest.

00:27:49.030 --> 00:27:49.980
Even so, you still caught up to us.

00:27:50.830 --> 00:27:51.220
What's wrong?

00:27:51.680 --> 00:27:52.570
Do you wish to see me

00:27:52.590 --> 00:27:53.290
that badly?

00:27:53.550 --> 00:27:55.050
You two can't travel fast due to the carriage.

00:27:55.680 --> 00:27:56.700
Of course I can catch up to you two.

00:27:57.550 --> 00:27:58.180
Did Umbrella Ghost

00:27:58.750 --> 00:27:59.660
leave you behind?

00:28:00.510 --> 00:28:01.090
That's right.

00:28:01.510 --> 00:28:02.620
You see, other people

00:28:02.880 --> 00:28:03.940
don't treat me that nicely.

00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:04.810
Unlike you, Xuanwu Guardian.

00:28:05.720 --> 00:28:07.420
I still remember

00:28:07.790 --> 00:28:09.090
your warm embrace last night.

00:28:09.790 --> 00:28:11.140
You have a warm body.

00:28:11.510 --> 00:28:12.530
Why are you pretending

00:28:12.640 --> 00:28:13.660
to be a cold person?

00:28:13.830 --> 00:28:14.090
You!

00:28:20.270 --> 00:28:21.770
Do you actually think that I won't kill you?

00:28:22.240 --> 00:28:22.900
Of course not.

00:28:23.640 --> 00:28:25.180
The martial world is never short of passionate men.

00:28:25.720 --> 00:28:26.250
However,

00:28:26.920 --> 00:28:28.180
they always lose their passion

00:28:28.590 --> 00:28:29.570
soon after.

00:28:30.070 --> 00:28:30.620
Although

00:28:30.720 --> 00:28:32.220
you may have fallen for me that night,

00:28:32.790 --> 00:28:34.620
you might have forgotten about me the next day.

00:28:35.720 --> 00:28:36.700
Or perhaps,

00:28:37.400 --> 00:28:39.140
seeking vengeance is more important to you.

00:28:39.750 --> 00:28:41.420
Perhaps a relationship isn't as important to you.

00:28:43.400 --> 00:28:44.010
Who knows?

00:28:44.640 --> 00:28:45.570
Who said I fell for you?

00:28:45.720 --> 00:28:46.770
I wonder who's flustered here.

00:28:50.030 --> 00:28:52.220
Although my beauty is unparalleled,

00:28:52.880 --> 00:28:54.290

you and I

are just fleeting acquaintances.

00:28:59.880 --> 00:29:00.770
It's a transient love affair.

00:29:01.960 --> 00:29:03.290
You might think that you have fallen for me at first glance,

00:29:03.960 --> 00:29:05.090
but you're just after my body.

00:29:05.790 --> 00:29:06.810
In the end, you have no deep feelings

00:29:06.830 --> 00:29:07.730
for me.

00:29:09.070 --> 00:29:09.490
I understand.

00:29:11.110 --> 00:29:12.530
I'm just after your body?

I'm not killing you

I can no longer move.

00:34:14.190 --> 00:34:15.490
Just deal one more blow to me,

00:34:16.070 --> 00:34:16.780
and I'll die for sure.

00:34:17.360 --> 00:34:18.570
Do you think I'm that dumb?

00:34:18.960 --> 00:34:20.210
Who knows what kind of tricks you're up to?

00:34:22.110 --> 00:34:22.690
Someone!

00:34:32.110 --> 00:34:33.690
If you encounter any issues,

00:34:34.110 --> 00:34:34.820
just

00:34:35.230 --> 00:34:36.610
tug this rope.

00:34:37.070 --> 00:34:37.900
The wooden bird

00:34:38.110 --> 00:34:39.780
will relay the sound through vibration.

00:34:40.550 --> 00:34:41.210
And I'll rush to your side

00:34:41.440 --> 00:34:43.940
as fast as I can.
