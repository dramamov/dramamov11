kissasia.cam or kisskh.org

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:37.936
We hit 1000,000 subscribers.

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:43.184
You, bitch.

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:44.296
We shot it 10 times.

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:45.024
You ruined it every single time.

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:46.552
It’s your fault, Kat.

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:48.352
Did you just blame me?

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:50.352
No.

00:00:50.376 --> 00:00:53.856
I blamed the fan, the curtain, and the lamp.

00:00:53.896 --> 00:00:55.016
Of course, I blamed you, idiot.

00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:57.704
You kept blocking my face.

00:00:57.720 --> 00:00:59.400
Calm down.

00:00:59.432 --> 00:01:00.000
Don’t be so harsh on her.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.248
Don’t be so harsh on her.

00:01:01.272 --> 00:01:03.008
No one wanted to ruin their own video.

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:05.576
Only idiots would do that.

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:10.344
Just reshoot it.

00:01:10.672 --> 00:01:12.670
Come to think about it.

00:01:12.696 --> 00:01:15.416
I think we need to emphasize in the video

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:18.024
that we are smart.

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:21.432
We don’t have time to reshoot it.

00:01:21.448 --> 00:01:25.232
I’m going to release this video
as soon as we hit 100,000 subscribers.

00:01:25.256 --> 00:01:27.656
Will we get to that point?

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:29.264
Of course, we will.

00:01:29.272 --> 00:01:30.160
Look.

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:31.744
See?

00:01:31.768 --> 00:01:33.352
We only need around 6,000 new subscribers.

00:01:33.368 --> 00:01:35.760
But the number has been stuck
for over a month.

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:38.464
Girls.

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:42.808
Why don’t we ask a higher power to help us?

00:01:43.888 --> 00:01:44.704
Higher power?

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:47.760
To increase our subscribers,

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:51.760
why don’t we pray to gods for help?

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:00.000
Airhead.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:00.512
Airhead.

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:03.080
Stop talking nonsense.

00:02:03.104 --> 00:02:03.920
So superstitious.

00:02:03.944 --> 00:02:04.696
Hey.

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:10.200
What the hell are you doing here?

00:02:10.224 --> 00:02:11.480
Why didn’t you go down to take photos?

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:13.016
Photos?

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:14.560
What photos?

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:16.424
Our class photos.

00:02:16.448 --> 00:02:17.600
Everyone is waiting for you.

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:19.256
Shit.

00:02:19.272 --> 00:02:20.568
We are doing it today?

00:02:21.152 --> 00:02:22.104
We need to touch up our makeup first.

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:22.672
Wait a sec.

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:23.776
We need to touch up our makeup first.

00:02:23.808 --> 00:02:25.568
Nevia, my lipstick is fading.

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:26.272
Hurry up.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.864
It’s not the time for a makeup touch-up.

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:34.704
Butt out!

00:02:38.312 --> 00:02:39.648
Nevia, my lipstick is smudged.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:42.936
Can you help me with this?

00:03:17.064 --> 00:03:17.784
This way.

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:18.808
They are all here.

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:20.144
Ready?

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:21.360
One.

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:22.312
Two.

00:03:22.336 --> 00:03:23.256
Three.

00:04:20.290 --> 00:04:22.728
(They said God created the world.)

00:04:22.752 --> 00:04:25.224
(But it’s us, queers, who run the world.)

00:04:25.256 --> 00:04:29.392
(We have power, houses, cars, and crowns.)

00:04:29.408 --> 00:04:30.640
(We have been around throughout history.)

00:04:30.664 --> 00:04:32.944
(Now, it’s our time.)

00:04:32.976 --> 00:04:35.896
Hello.

00:04:35.928 --> 00:04:36.912
I’m Nevia.

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:38.224
I’m Fews.

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:40.192
I’m Ingky.

00:04:40.216 --> 00:04:42.608
I’m Katrina.

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:46.672
We are…

00:04:46.704 --> 00:04:50.256
Air Dolls.

00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:53.536
(We have four members.)

00:04:53.576 --> 00:04:54.648
Hello.

00:04:54.856 --> 00:04:57.208
I’m Darunee Laohongyokfah.

00:04:57.232 --> 00:04:59.210
(This is Ingky.)

00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:00.000
(Her dream is to become
the next Miss International Queen.)

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.544
(Her dream is to become
the next Miss International Queen.)

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:07.488
The winner of this year is…

00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:11.848
Ingky from Grade 12 Class 2.

00:05:11.864 --> 00:05:14.380
Please give her a round of applause.

00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:16.136
(She’s a bit annoying sometimes.)

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:19.624
(But I have to admit that she’s pretty.)

00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:20.520
What a brat!

00:05:24.376 --> 00:05:30.200
If we are not active as an environmentalist,

00:05:30.232 --> 00:05:33.160
We are responsible for…

00:05:33.192 --> 00:05:34.264
(This is Fews.)

00:05:34.288 --> 00:05:37.384
(She is the academic and
walking encyclopedia in our group.)

00:05:37.650 --> 00:05:39.416
(She knows everything.
She’s an expert on everything.)

00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:40.512
(She is a know-it-all.)

00:05:40.544 --> 00:05:44.616
(Her life’s goal is to get a hot boyfriend.)

00:05:45.270 --> 00:05:50.120
(Do you think all the knowledge she has
is helpful for her goal?)

00:05:50.304 --> 00:05:51.544
(That’s…)

00:05:55.340 --> 00:05:59.096
(The next member is Kat, Katrina.)

00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:00.000
(She said her parents gave her the name
when she was born.)

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:03.408
(She said her parents gave her the name
when she was born.)

00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:06.448
(But we all know that it’s a lie.)

00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:08.744
(From my speculation,)

00:06:09.030 --> 00:06:11.592
(She is a fan of Katriona Gray.)

00:06:12.170 --> 00:06:14.600
(But she was stupid and
forgot to write the letter O in her name.)

00:06:14.624 --> 00:06:17.328
(So her name ended up
with the spelling Katrina.)

00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:19.664
(What kind of person is she?)

00:06:19.712 --> 00:06:21.992
(I’ll let you see for yourself.)

00:06:36.990 --> 00:06:40.720
(The last member is me, Nevia.)

00:06:43.420 --> 00:06:44.440
(I’m the face of this group.)

00:06:44.464 --> 00:06:46.784
(I’m both pretty and smart.)

00:06:46.808 --> 00:06:49.584
(I’m the one
who holds the Air Dolls members together.)

00:06:49.608 --> 00:06:54.224
(I’m also the group’s leader.)

00:06:54.920 --> 00:06:55.880
Bitch.

00:06:56.500 --> 00:06:57.552
You’re such a liar.

00:06:58.200 --> 00:06:59.008
True.

00:06:59.032 --> 00:07:00.000
You only talk trash about us.

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:00.624
You only talk trash about us.

00:07:00.640 --> 00:07:01.328
But when it comes to yourself,

00:07:01.360 --> 00:07:03.944
you compliment and speak well of yourself.

00:07:03.960 --> 00:07:06.496
I’m just telling the truth.

00:07:06.520 --> 00:07:08.472
I just answered their question.

00:07:08.488 --> 00:07:09.592
Hey!

00:07:09.600 --> 00:07:10.528
What?!

00:07:10.544 --> 00:07:11.632
P’Pat is watching our live.

00:07:12.540 --> 00:07:13.656
P’Pat?

00:07:13.672 --> 00:07:14.456
P’Pat?

00:07:14.472 --> 00:07:16.736
P’Pat, you watch all our live streams.

00:07:16.776 --> 00:07:18.368
Do you have a crush on us?

00:07:21.470 --> 00:07:22.960
Someone wants to join our live.

00:07:22.976 --> 00:07:23.610
Hurry up.

00:07:25.860 --> 00:07:26.544
Five.

00:07:26.800 --> 00:07:27.624
Four.

00:07:27.648 --> 00:07:28.472
Three.

00:07:29.160 --> 00:07:30.680
P’Pat is here.

00:07:32.270 --> 00:07:33.536
Hello, girls.

00:07:34.840 --> 00:07:37.520
You are so cute, P’Pat.

00:07:38.790 --> 00:07:41.080
I’m here to answer your question.

00:07:41.112 --> 00:07:42.448
Of course, I like you.

00:07:42.488 --> 00:07:43.656
I absolutely adore you.

00:07:45.660 --> 00:07:47.808
(This is P’Pat.)

00:07:47.840 --> 00:07:50.088
(He’s our adorable junior at school.)

00:07:50.900 --> 00:07:54.048
(Why do we call him P’Pat?)

00:07:54.080 --> 00:07:57.312
(Because we want to call him that
even though he’s younger.)

00:07:57.320 --> 00:07:58.840
(Stop asking about it.)

00:08:07.430 --> 00:08:12.928
(He’s like a lottery jackpot
that all of us dream of winning.)

00:08:13.800 --> 00:08:15.768
(It’s a once-in-a-lifetime dream.)

00:08:22.820 --> 00:08:24.128
If P’Pat asks me for a favor,

00:08:24.830 --> 00:08:27.120
I’ll do everything he wants me to do.

00:08:27.570 --> 00:08:29.464
If he tells me to lick his foot,

00:08:29.480 --> 00:08:30.928
I’ll do it.

00:08:35.550 --> 00:08:37.360
His feet are cleaner than your face.

00:08:38.770 --> 00:08:40.600
Since you talk about him,

00:08:40.640 --> 00:08:42.776
After P’Pat joined our live,

00:08:43.170 --> 00:08:45.232
the number of our subscribers
has been increasing

00:08:45.632 --> 00:08:48.304
We will definitely hit 100,000 subscribers.

00:08:50.300 --> 00:08:52.472
We will get to release
our celebratory video soon.

00:08:55.470 --> 00:09:00.000
But I think we should do something
more special than releasing the video.

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:00.264
But I think we should do something
more special than releasing the video.

00:09:05.700 --> 00:09:08.472
We should hold a party.

00:09:17.120 --> 00:09:19.968
Congratulations on hitting 100,000 subscribers.

00:09:20.560 --> 00:09:22.224
Good job.

00:09:42.590 --> 00:09:43.272
Deal.

00:09:45.624 --> 00:09:49.056
100,000 SUBSCRIBERS.

00:10:11.016 --> 00:10:12.728
Is there a crow in my house?

00:10:14.760 --> 00:10:16.224
It must be our guests.

00:10:16.490 --> 00:10:17.328
I’ll open the door.

00:10:17.360 --> 00:10:18.152
Good.

00:10:19.350 --> 00:10:20.592
Who is it?

00:10:23.320 --> 00:10:24.528
Here is the food you ordered.

00:10:24.560 --> 00:10:25.864
Did you order it?

00:10:27.100 --> 00:10:29.320
Why did no one come to our party?

00:10:29.352 --> 00:10:32.152
Ing, did you post on the wrong date?

00:10:32.168 --> 00:10:33.176
What?

00:10:33.216 --> 00:10:35.296
Why are you blaming me?

00:10:35.656 --> 00:10:37.660
You are the one who made the poster.

00:10:37.690 --> 00:10:39.720
Did you put the wrong date in it?

00:10:39.768 --> 00:10:41.624
Girls, is it because…

00:10:47.680 --> 00:10:49.064
Damn, I forgot what to say.

00:10:50.040 --> 00:10:51.000
Crap!

00:10:52.770 --> 00:10:54.040
Hello, P’Tob.

00:10:54.072 --> 00:10:56.816
You are coming to my party, right?

00:10:56.864 --> 00:10:58.104
Huh? No?

00:10:58.144 --> 00:10:59.896
Oh, you’re stuck in traffic.

00:10:59.920 --> 00:11:00.000
Okay.

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:01.424
Okay.

00:11:02.930 --> 00:11:04.232
Hello, James.

00:11:04.256 --> 00:11:06.008
You will arrive soon, right?

00:11:06.048 --> 00:11:08.010
The party will start in a few minutes.

00:11:08.048 --> 00:11:10.010
(Who the hell is James?
This is not his phone.)

00:11:10.048 --> 00:11:11.912
(Did you tell others that my name is James?)

00:11:11.936 --> 00:11:13.392
(Nonsense. I never said that.)

00:11:14.180 --> 00:11:15.960
Sorry. I called the wrong number.

00:11:15.984 --> 00:11:17.360
(Wait. Don’t hang up. We need to talk.)

00:11:21.360 --> 00:11:22.672
(Hello, P’Ingky.)

00:11:22.690 --> 00:11:25.400
Anyeong. Ni Hao. Hello, P’Pat.

00:11:25.440 --> 00:11:27.896
You are coming to my party, right?

00:11:27.920 --> 00:11:29.200
I didn’t forget it.

00:11:29.224 --> 00:11:31.264
But my schedule in the province
took longer than I expected.

00:11:31.280 --> 00:11:32.432
I don’t think I can make it.

00:11:32.440 --> 00:11:33.608
I’m sorry.

00:11:33.632 --> 00:11:34.128
Huh?

00:11:35.080 --> 00:11:37.744
Huh? You really can’t make it?

00:11:37.768 --> 00:11:38.976
(I’m sorry.)

00:11:39.832 --> 00:11:41.008
It’s okay.

00:11:41.350 --> 00:11:42.320
Girls.

00:11:42.760 --> 00:11:43.800
Who the hell is this brat?

00:11:43.832 --> 00:11:45.368
Hi.

00:11:45.400 --> 00:11:48.312
Don’t forget about the party at my house
this Saturday.

00:11:48.352 --> 00:11:51.600
You are all invited.

00:11:52.936 --> 00:11:54.940
She holds a party on the same day as ours.

00:11:55.460 --> 00:11:58.360
Why is P’Tob at her party?

00:11:58.400 --> 00:11:59.872
He told me that he was stuck in traffic.

00:11:59.888 --> 00:12:00.000
Asshole.

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:00.432
Asshole.

00:12:01.030 --> 00:12:02.080
Damn.

00:12:02.770 --> 00:12:03.880
Her content is so lame.

00:12:03.912 --> 00:12:04.784
She is so no one.

00:12:04.800 --> 00:12:07.160
Shit, she’s famous.

00:12:08.460 --> 00:12:09.520
I found it.

00:12:09.544 --> 00:12:11.688
Her viral video.

00:12:13.576 --> 00:12:15.296
I’m sick of applying skincare.

00:12:15.344 --> 00:12:17.624
I spent a fortune on skincare.

00:12:17.640 --> 00:12:19.472
I invested a lot in my skin.

00:12:19.488 --> 00:12:22.200
I went to see a dermatologist
and all kinds of experts.

00:12:22.232 --> 00:12:24.496
I wear makeup and put on lipstick.

00:12:25.280 --> 00:12:26.184
But I still can’t find a boyfriend.

00:12:26.580 --> 00:12:27.368
What?

00:12:27.640 --> 00:12:29.232
It got a million likes?

00:12:29.264 --> 00:12:30.024
Yeah.

00:12:30.048 --> 00:12:31.136
This lame video?

00:12:31.416 --> 00:12:32.584
Right.

00:12:33.780 --> 00:12:36.136
This is what I wanted to tell you, but I forgot.

00:12:36.660 --> 00:12:37.392
What?

00:12:37.952 --> 00:12:41.304
This brat is holding a party
on the same day as ours.

00:12:43.780 --> 00:12:45.368
Thank you for telling me.

00:12:45.400 --> 00:12:46.400
It’s not a big deal.

00:12:46.432 --> 00:12:48.856
Why didn’t you wait to tell me
in the next lifetime, idiot?

00:12:49.460 --> 00:12:50.976
Look.

00:12:51.750 --> 00:12:53.144
I go to her Facebook feed.

00:12:53.176 --> 00:12:54.648
Look at the dates.

00:12:54.990 --> 00:12:56.568
They are the same day.

00:12:56.592 --> 00:12:58.056
She definitely prayed to the goddess for help.

00:12:58.088 --> 00:12:59.248
You’re right.

00:12:59.288 --> 00:13:00.000
Nonsense.

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:00.320
Nonsense.

00:13:00.352 --> 00:13:04.448
Don’t you see that all her videos went viral
after she prayed to the goddess for help?

00:13:04.488 --> 00:13:06.976
The goddess must be powerful.

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:07.872
That’s probably true.

00:13:07.896 --> 00:13:10.448
What kind of goddess is named Dalp?

00:13:10.480 --> 00:13:11.784
Her name is Dalop, bitch.

00:13:11.800 --> 00:13:14.016
GODDESS DALOP.

00:13:15.100 --> 00:13:16.496
What are we doing here?

00:13:18.300 --> 00:13:19.080
Girls.

00:13:19.530 --> 00:13:21.720
I can feel mysterious energy.

00:13:22.512 --> 00:13:23.712
I got goosebumps.

00:13:23.728 --> 00:13:25.416
Kat, you are having nature calls, aren’t you?

00:13:25.456 --> 00:13:26.576
Yes, I am.

00:13:27.670 --> 00:13:28.784
Come on, girls.

00:13:29.300 --> 00:13:30.424
Since we are here,

00:13:31.780 --> 00:13:32.432
let’s go in.

00:13:32.850 --> 00:13:33.496
let’s go in.

00:13:49.088 --> 00:13:51.090
How do we know that she’s powerful?

00:13:51.776 --> 00:13:53.780
If you don’t believe in her power,
why are you paying respect to her?

00:13:55.660 --> 00:13:57.152
Because I’m a Thai.

00:13:58.320 --> 00:14:00.000
Goddess, if you are as sacred as they say.

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:01.456
Goddess, if you are as sacred as they say.

00:14:01.500 --> 00:14:07.464
Please pick a stick with the number
that is on my mind.

00:14:17.760 --> 00:14:20.184
She’s really sacred.

00:14:21.190 --> 00:14:22.120
Brat!

00:14:22.144 --> 00:14:25.000
How would I know
what number was on your mind, Ingky?

00:14:25.024 --> 00:14:26.552
Pick a number and write it on a paper.

00:14:26.576 --> 00:14:27.496
Then do it again.

00:14:27.920 --> 00:14:28.680
So picky.

00:14:29.880 --> 00:14:30.744
Stop it.

00:14:31.140 --> 00:14:31.816
Alright.

00:14:32.260 --> 00:14:33.184
I’ll do it.

00:14:33.200 --> 00:14:34.952
Goddess, if you are real,

00:14:35.380 --> 00:14:41.656
please help me lift this elephant
with my pinky finger.

00:14:50.620 --> 00:14:51.488
See?

00:14:52.380 --> 00:14:55.264
I can lift it.

00:14:57.280 --> 00:14:58.264
Bitch.

00:14:58.496 --> 00:15:00.000
Look at your muscles.

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:00.500
Look at your muscles.

00:15:00.536 --> 00:15:02.500
You can even lift a real elephant with it.

00:15:04.790 --> 00:15:05.712
Goddess.

00:15:06.460 --> 00:15:08.168
If you are real,

00:15:09.780 --> 00:15:11.248
please make my left foot stinky.

00:15:14.540 --> 00:15:16.320
How is it? Is it stinky?

00:15:16.620 --> 00:15:17.328
Yes.

00:15:17.360 --> 00:15:18.864
Yes, it is, bitch.

00:15:19.910 --> 00:15:22.464
Isn’t your foot normally stinky?

00:15:22.810 --> 00:15:23.712
Let’s try again.

00:15:24.500 --> 00:15:26.144
If you are real,

00:15:26.160 --> 00:15:27.880
please get rid of the smell from my left foot.

00:15:31.230 --> 00:15:32.512
Stop it, bitch.

00:15:33.010 --> 00:15:34.544
Put your face away from me.

00:15:34.560 --> 00:15:35.592
It’s my foot.

00:15:47.010 --> 00:15:49.704
If you are here to challenge her,

00:15:50.570 --> 00:15:52.768
you will get nothing from her.

00:15:57.660 --> 00:15:59.288
I’m Medtubtim.

00:15:59.560 --> 00:16:00.000
You can call me…

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:01.328
You can call me…

00:16:02.320 --> 00:16:03.024
Med.

00:16:03.224 --> 00:16:05.020
How can I help you?

00:16:05.380 --> 00:16:11.624
I want to know
if the goddess is really powerful.

00:16:14.110 --> 00:16:19.816
The goddess doesn’t need
to prove herself to you.

00:16:21.730 --> 00:16:26.136
You are the one
who needs to prove yourself to the goddess.

00:16:26.670 --> 00:16:27.880
Prove?

00:16:28.180 --> 00:16:29.560
Prove what?

00:16:30.060 --> 00:16:31.560
Your faith.

00:16:32.470 --> 00:16:36.896
Nowadays, people try to rationalize everything.

00:16:38.100 --> 00:16:41.400
They only believe in things
that are scientifically proven.

00:16:42.540 --> 00:16:45.696
If you have doubts from the beginning,

00:16:46.440 --> 00:16:48.152
how would you know…

00:16:48.856 --> 00:16:54.128
if the goddess is powerful?

00:16:55.816 --> 00:16:58.128
Amen.

00:16:58.700 --> 00:16:59.696
Med.

00:17:00.260 --> 00:17:02.080
What do we need to do?

00:17:03.190 --> 00:17:05.408
That’s a good question.

00:17:06.020 --> 00:17:07.680
A 5x7-inch photo costs 1,000 baht.

00:17:07.710 --> 00:17:11.632
If you want a larger one,
we have a 12x16-inch photo for 2,500 baht.

00:17:11.648 --> 00:17:13.250
Why don’t you get a larger one?

00:17:29.160 --> 00:17:31.400
She must be very sacred.

00:17:32.070 --> 00:17:33.360
Otherwise, we wouldn’t have bought it.

00:17:33.740 --> 00:17:35.360
Maybe we are scammed.

00:17:35.830 --> 00:17:37.160
It’s still inconclusive.

00:17:39.950 --> 00:17:40.744
Girls.

00:17:42.500 --> 00:17:43.872
I can really feel it.

00:17:44.410 --> 00:17:46.320
I can feel that the goddess is holding me.

00:17:53.080 --> 00:17:54.896
I don’t think she’s holding you.

00:17:57.610 --> 00:17:59.840
Let’s do it all.

00:18:01.660 --> 00:18:04.448
HOW TO PAY RESPECT
TO GODDESS DALOP.

00:18:04.740 --> 00:18:08.120
These are guidelines
on how to pay respect to the goddess.

00:18:08.152 --> 00:18:09.200
First,

00:18:09.224 --> 00:18:12.200
You need to light incense sticks and candles,
and pay respect to her every day.

00:18:12.240 --> 00:18:14.504
The incense sticks must be rose-scented.

00:18:14.536 --> 00:18:15.784
You cannot use other scents.

00:18:16.260 --> 00:18:17.624
It’s available here.
ROSE INCENSE STICKS: 1,000 BAHT

00:18:18.770 --> 00:18:24.008
Secondly, you need to take pride
in being a trans woman.

00:18:24.048 --> 00:18:25.424
Do not turn into a gay.

00:18:25.448 --> 00:18:26.728
Otherwise, you will be cursed.

00:18:28.170 --> 00:18:33.672
Thirdly, you need to work your charm
every day.

00:18:33.944 --> 00:18:35.104
How?

00:18:35.580 --> 00:18:39.024
Girls, do we really need to get ten matches?

00:18:39.056 --> 00:18:41.176
I’m stuck at nine matches for a while.

00:18:41.208 --> 00:18:42.264
What should I do?

00:18:42.280 --> 00:18:44.176
Am I going to be cursed?

00:18:47.250 --> 00:18:48.256
I got ten matches.

00:18:49.860 --> 00:18:53.696
Fourthly, this is very important.

00:18:53.920 --> 00:18:57.496
All of you must be a fighter.

00:18:58.450 --> 00:19:00.000
What do you mean?

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:02.048
What do you mean?

00:19:02.088 --> 00:19:05.248
Every day, you need to win
at least one battle.

00:19:05.840 --> 00:19:08.080
We need to fight.

00:19:09.780 --> 00:19:15.448
We need to fight to win.

00:19:15.480 --> 00:19:16.128
FIGHT CLUB.

00:19:16.152 --> 00:19:17.904
If you want to join our club,

00:19:17.928 --> 00:19:19.200
the second rule is…

00:19:19.992 --> 00:19:23.040
that our club holds a competition every week.

00:19:23.072 --> 00:19:24.136
If you lose in the fight,

00:19:24.160 --> 00:19:26.520
you will be a servant for the winner
for seven days.

00:19:26.552 --> 00:19:28.648
Excuse me. What is the first rule?

00:19:28.664 --> 00:19:30.488
You need to wait.

00:19:30.504 --> 00:19:31.744
The first rule is not important.

00:19:31.768 --> 00:19:32.592
I’ll talk about it later.

00:19:35.090 --> 00:19:35.808
Alright.

00:19:36.540 --> 00:19:40.824
The first rule is that
you can’t tell anyone about the fight club.

00:19:40.840 --> 00:19:41.416
Hey.

00:19:43.060 --> 00:19:44.088
Asshole Bank.

00:19:45.510 --> 00:19:46.928
What are you doing here?

00:19:46.960 --> 00:19:48.144
Who told you about this place?

00:19:48.168 --> 00:19:49.384
This is a secret club.

00:19:49.400 --> 00:19:50.848
Secret club, your ass!

00:19:50.880 --> 00:19:52.520
You posted about it on Facebook.

00:19:58.860 --> 00:20:00.000
Will you fight with me?

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:00.136
Will you fight with me?

00:20:02.208 --> 00:20:03.872
Come on, Bank.

00:20:04.504 --> 00:20:06.504
Let’s kick her ass.

00:20:08.120 --> 00:20:09.384
Show her what you got.

00:20:09.416 --> 00:20:10.488
Go for it.

00:20:12.520 --> 00:20:14.064
Come on, Bank.

00:20:19.200 --> 00:20:20.816
Have you learned boxing?

00:20:31.608 --> 00:20:33.610
1 WEEK LATER.

00:20:36.650 --> 00:20:37.648
Get me some drinks.

00:20:38.600 --> 00:20:39.264
What?

00:20:45.744 --> 00:20:47.740
Thank you, Bankie.

00:20:59.280 --> 00:21:00.000
Did you beat Bank in the boxing match?

00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:01.144
Did you beat Bank in the boxing match?

00:21:01.540 --> 00:21:02.488
You defeated Bank?

00:21:02.512 --> 00:21:04.288
He’s such a noob.

00:21:08.580 --> 00:21:10.232
What are you doing?

00:21:10.256 --> 00:21:12.448
I was fighting with it at the back of the school.

00:21:16.800 --> 00:21:18.056
You’re almost bitten.

00:21:18.080 --> 00:21:19.544
This is not what she meant.

00:21:20.250 --> 00:21:21.728
No, keep it away from me.

00:21:24.488 --> 00:21:25.616
You, bastard.

00:21:30.800 --> 00:21:32.024
It’s probably dead.

00:21:33.380 --> 00:21:34.296
Girls.

00:21:34.328 --> 00:21:36.080
Let’s talk about this.

00:21:36.104 --> 00:21:38.456
We have been following the guidelines
for over a week.

00:21:38.488 --> 00:21:40.328
We still don’t see any result.

00:21:40.360 --> 00:21:41.904
The number of our subscribers
hasn’t increased.

00:21:46.120 --> 00:21:47.088
Girls.

00:21:47.460 --> 00:21:48.160
What?

00:21:48.320 --> 00:21:49.192
It’s increasing.

00:21:53.980 --> 00:21:54.496
It’s increasing.

00:21:54.536 --> 00:21:55.440
Let me see.

00:21:56.500 --> 00:21:57.336
Girls.

00:21:57.368 --> 00:21:58.470
It’s really increasing.

00:21:58.504 --> 00:22:00.000
It almost hit 100,000 subscribers.

00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:00.984
It almost hit 100,000 subscribers.

00:22:01.016 --> 00:22:02.304
Girls.

00:22:02.312 --> 00:22:06.672
A YouTuber who has 200,000 subscribers
wants us to appear on her channel.

00:22:07.580 --> 00:22:11.184
My inbox is flooded with DMs.

00:22:13.970 --> 00:22:15.424
Girls, P’Pat mentioned me.

00:22:18.870 --> 00:22:20.064
Brace yourself for me, P’Pat.

00:22:21.500 --> 00:22:26.248
Why don’t we hold a party again?

00:22:26.296 --> 00:22:30.912
Okay. Let’s go.

00:22:35.440 --> 00:22:37.536
Thank you, Goddess,

00:22:37.560 --> 00:22:39.264
for helping us get where we are today.

00:22:39.296 --> 00:22:42.432
Please help our party today go smoothly.

00:22:42.472 --> 00:22:44.144
If you can help us on this,

00:22:44.176 --> 00:22:48.312
I promise we will upgrade the offering to you.

00:22:49.640 --> 00:22:52.696
Amen.

00:23:03.320 --> 00:23:06.736
There’s another important thing
you need to bear in mind.

00:23:07.050 --> 00:23:12.104
When your wishes are granted,

00:23:12.720 --> 00:23:18.944
you need to remember
that the goddess is only an extra help.

00:23:18.968 --> 00:23:23.448
You will do well or not,
that’s up to your actions.

00:23:24.040 --> 00:23:25.264
Don’t forget it.

00:23:26.460 --> 00:23:27.672
Anyway.

00:23:28.410 --> 00:23:30.584
Did you follow the goddess’s guidelines today?

00:23:32.632 --> 00:23:33.712
Yes.

00:23:33.728 --> 00:23:35.056
That’s good.

00:23:41.540 --> 00:23:42.504
How did the candles go off?

00:23:42.528 --> 00:23:43.544
It must be the goddess.

00:23:43.560 --> 00:23:44.832
It went off right after we lit them.

00:23:44.848 --> 00:23:45.880
The goddess did it.

00:23:47.624 --> 00:23:48.544
Brat.

00:23:48.870 --> 00:23:49.720
Turn it off, bitch.

00:23:49.752 --> 00:23:50.792
Put it away.

00:23:57.710 --> 00:24:00.000
Everyone, welcome to our party.

00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:01.968
Everyone, welcome to our party.

00:24:06.980 --> 00:24:09.048
Oh, the man over there.

00:24:09.072 --> 00:24:10.584
Did you bring your own drink?

00:24:10.608 --> 00:24:12.416
Can you put it away?

00:24:12.448 --> 00:24:18.264
Because our party is fun without alcohol.

00:24:19.750 --> 00:24:22.536
Don’t leave yet.

00:24:22.568 --> 00:24:29.184
We have prepared a special performance
to express our gratitude to you.

00:24:32.840 --> 00:24:37.624
And now, let’s enjoy the party.

00:24:43.460 --> 00:24:45.080
Do as we’ve planned.

00:24:45.104 --> 00:24:46.392
Don’t make any mistakes.

00:24:46.980 --> 00:24:49.104
Fews, you are in charge of the guest list.

00:24:49.120 --> 00:24:49.720
Sure.

00:24:49.744 --> 00:24:52.248
Ing, keep our guests entertained.

00:24:52.850 --> 00:24:55.448
Kat, you are in charge of the food.

00:24:55.488 --> 00:24:56.616
- Sure.
- Okay. Let’s go.

00:24:57.740 --> 00:24:58.616
Shit.

00:24:58.960 --> 00:25:00.000
So I won’t be at the party like you.

00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:00.784
So I won’t be at the party like you.

00:25:02.160 --> 00:25:04.160
You can come out at 8 p.m.

00:25:04.200 --> 00:25:06.160
Your job is the most important.

00:25:06.184 --> 00:25:08.024
Enjoy the party.

00:25:28.480 --> 00:25:29.400
What?

00:25:30.190 --> 00:25:31.864
What are you doing here?

00:25:31.888 --> 00:25:33.288
Why aren’t you greeting our guests?

00:25:33.328 --> 00:25:35.144
I just take a break.

00:25:35.700 --> 00:25:37.160
You look tired.

00:25:37.192 --> 00:25:39.224
Fews, why don’t you take a rest?

00:25:39.240 --> 00:25:42.240
I’ll cover it for you.

00:25:42.264 --> 00:25:43.464
Go.

00:25:44.940 --> 00:25:46.152
P’Pat.

00:25:46.176 --> 00:25:46.792
Ingky.

00:25:48.330 --> 00:25:49.248
I miss you.

00:25:51.620 --> 00:25:52.536
Paul?

00:25:53.810 --> 00:25:55.688
Paul from the dating app?

00:25:55.720 --> 00:25:56.544
Yes.

00:25:56.576 --> 00:25:58.472
Your friend helped me with my plan.

00:25:58.960 --> 00:26:00.000
I want to come here to surprise you.

00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:01.432
I want to come here to surprise you.

00:26:04.150 --> 00:26:08.160
Paul, come with me. We need to talk.

00:26:08.400 --> 00:26:09.032
Wrong way.

00:26:23.220 --> 00:26:24.528
Hi, the party’s host.

00:26:24.552 --> 00:26:25.784
Congratulations.

00:26:25.800 --> 00:26:26.864
You are now a big celebrity.

00:26:27.930 --> 00:26:29.456
Thank you, P’Pat.

00:26:30.610 --> 00:26:34.296
Where are the other members?

00:26:34.328 --> 00:26:36.464
I want to congratulate them, too.

00:26:37.500 --> 00:26:40.096
They are busy with their duties.

00:26:40.720 --> 00:26:45.800
Tonight, I’ll show you around our party.

00:26:45.824 --> 00:26:46.712
Sure.

00:26:46.728 --> 00:26:48.872
Hey, Fews.

00:26:49.200 --> 00:26:51.632
Hello, P’Pat.

00:26:51.672 --> 00:26:54.848
Fews, we have a small problem in the kitchen.

00:26:54.888 --> 00:26:57.000
Can you please go and check it?

00:26:57.040 --> 00:27:00.000
Work in the kitchen is not my expertise.

00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:00.632
Work in the kitchen is not my expertise.

00:27:00.664 --> 00:27:02.648
Why don’t you check it yourself?

00:27:04.250 --> 00:27:07.416
Will you go? Or should I tell him
you took his photo with you to a bathroom?

00:27:11.660 --> 00:27:16.096
P’Pat, excuse me. This is quite important.

00:27:16.128 --> 00:27:19.168
This idiot won’t be able to handle it.

00:27:19.680 --> 00:27:21.680
Please take care of it, Fews.

00:27:28.630 --> 00:27:30.912
Your party looks great.

00:27:30.936 --> 00:27:32.816
You never let me down, Nevia.

00:27:32.848 --> 00:27:35.808
I didn’t do much.

00:27:35.848 --> 00:27:38.392
I just arranged everything for the party.

00:27:38.680 --> 00:27:39.560
Everything?

00:27:39.600 --> 00:27:41.624
Yeah. It’s not that hard.

00:27:43.820 --> 00:27:47.056
Bank, thank you for helping me
with the party.

00:27:47.088 --> 00:27:50.480
Can you take the ice
and give it to Kat in the kitchen?

00:27:50.520 --> 00:27:52.240
Thank you, Bankie.

00:27:52.272 --> 00:27:53.512
What the hell are you doing?

00:27:53.536 --> 00:27:54.288
You scare me.

00:27:55.300 --> 00:27:57.912
P’Pat, did you get any drink?

00:27:58.300 --> 00:27:59.016
Enjoy.

00:27:59.048 --> 00:27:59.944
Enjoy.

00:28:02.460 --> 00:28:04.120
Darling.

00:28:04.136 --> 00:28:06.048
I’m carrying two bags of ice.

00:28:06.080 --> 00:28:07.328
I’m exhausted.

00:28:07.352 --> 00:28:08.720
Don’t you have any reward for me?

00:28:09.180 --> 00:28:09.960
Darling?

00:28:09.992 --> 00:28:11.008
Darling, your ass!

00:28:11.048 --> 00:28:12.088
Who is this?

00:28:12.120 --> 00:28:13.568
I’m her man.

00:28:13.600 --> 00:28:16.016
I’m her man, bro.

00:28:17.670 --> 00:28:18.584
No.

00:28:19.090 --> 00:28:20.000
No.

00:28:20.530 --> 00:28:23.072
I never knew you have a boyfriend, Nevia.

00:28:23.104 --> 00:28:25.736
You never heard of me?

00:28:25.768 --> 00:28:28.136
We’ve been dating for seven years.

00:28:31.568 --> 00:28:34.016
Excuse me.

00:28:34.048 --> 00:28:34.960
Yes, sir.

00:28:35.008 --> 00:28:38.032
P’Pat, it’s not what you think.

00:28:38.064 --> 00:28:38.808
P’Pat.

00:28:38.832 --> 00:28:39.672
P’Pat.

00:28:40.950 --> 00:28:42.248
P’Pat.

00:28:45.100 --> 00:28:45.720
What?

00:28:45.752 --> 00:28:46.416
P’Pat.

00:28:50.100 --> 00:28:52.128
Why do you barely answer my chat lately?

00:28:54.940 --> 00:28:56.272
Paul.

00:28:56.288 --> 00:28:59.688
My life is a bit hectic right now.

00:28:59.704 --> 00:29:00.000
My phone is not functioning well.

00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:03.240
My phone is not functioning well.

00:29:04.060 --> 00:29:06.728
Ingky, I bought a tangerine for you.

00:29:07.700 --> 00:29:08.656
Tangerine?

00:29:09.530 --> 00:29:13.272
You are so sweet, Paul.

00:29:13.296 --> 00:29:15.152
You remember that I like tangerines.

00:29:16.830 --> 00:29:18.912
I can feed you all night.

00:29:23.380 --> 00:29:24.968
I’m really sorry.

00:29:25.008 --> 00:29:27.552
But I need to go back
to help my friends with the party.

00:29:27.568 --> 00:29:28.368
Thank you.

00:29:33.208 --> 00:29:33.944
Ingky.

00:29:35.080 --> 00:29:36.008
Where have you been?

00:29:36.040 --> 00:29:37.912
I’ve been looking for you everywhere.

00:29:37.944 --> 00:29:39.496
I couldn’t sleep for three days.

00:29:39.536 --> 00:29:41.416
Can you please tell me what I am to you?

00:29:41.456 --> 00:29:43.420
This is driving me crazy.

00:29:45.420 --> 00:29:47.420
When did you get here?

00:29:55.128 --> 00:29:56.904
I’m sorry.

00:29:56.928 --> 00:29:58.952
But I don’t have time to talk to you.

00:29:58.968 --> 00:30:00.000
My life is very hectic right now.

00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:00.712
My life is very hectic right now.

00:30:00.736 --> 00:30:03.584
You want to know what you are to me?

00:30:03.600 --> 00:30:05.352
You will never understand it.

00:30:05.672 --> 00:30:07.670
You are like a tangerine.

00:30:07.696 --> 00:30:09.176
But I am a banana.

00:30:09.470 --> 00:30:10.112
Huh?

00:30:10.144 --> 00:30:11.600
I don’t like tangerines.

00:30:11.624 --> 00:30:12.480
Remember it.

00:30:12.820 --> 00:30:13.712
- I’m sorry.
- Ingky.

00:30:16.290 --> 00:30:17.144
You forgot your tangerines.

00:30:17.160 --> 00:30:18.136
Paul.

00:30:18.740 --> 00:30:20.344
Why are you still here?

00:30:22.340 --> 00:30:24.096
Didn’t you say you don’t like tangerines?

00:30:24.360 --> 00:30:25.272
What is this?

00:30:25.592 --> 00:30:27.590
Didn’t you say I’m the only one for you?

00:30:29.740 --> 00:30:31.568
You also told me I’m your only one.

00:30:31.880 --> 00:30:32.880
Then what is this?

00:30:33.350 --> 00:30:34.040
Who is this average Joe?

00:30:34.064 --> 00:30:34.880
You are the average Joe.

00:30:34.896 --> 00:30:36.304
She and I are seeing each other.

00:30:36.320 --> 00:30:38.152
You are seeing her?

00:30:38.160 --> 00:30:39.200
There’s no way she's going out with you.

00:30:44.350 --> 00:30:46.752
I didn’t mean to eavesdrop.

00:30:46.776 --> 00:30:48.750
I just came out to answer a call.

00:30:49.420 --> 00:30:52.496
P’Pat, it’s not what you think.

00:30:52.528 --> 00:30:54.416
I just ran into them.

00:30:54.440 --> 00:30:55.896
It’s okay, Ingky.

00:30:55.920 --> 00:30:56.856
I get it.

00:30:58.180 --> 00:30:59.528
Thank you, P’Pat.

00:30:59.552 --> 00:31:00.000
Have fun with juggling between two men.

00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:01.016
Have fun with juggling between two men.

00:31:09.260 --> 00:31:11.480
What the hell is wrong with you?

00:31:11.800 --> 00:31:12.440
Why?

00:31:12.480 --> 00:31:13.072
Do you want to try me?

00:31:13.096 --> 00:31:13.928
Bring it on.

00:31:17.140 --> 00:31:18.520
Can you stop arguing?

00:31:19.136 --> 00:31:20.200
Get out of my house.

00:31:20.424 --> 00:31:21.432
Get out.

00:31:21.456 --> 00:31:22.640
Will you get out?

00:31:23.056 --> 00:31:23.824
This is my house.

00:31:23.850 --> 00:31:25.000
If you don’t leave, I will.

00:31:26.968 --> 00:31:28.330
What the heck?!

00:31:49.830 --> 00:31:50.744
Kat!

00:31:51.640 --> 00:31:52.976
Why are you drinking?

00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:54.832
You are a minor.

00:31:59.200 --> 00:32:00.000
Mr. KATRINA WANGRARENG.
BORN IN 2004.
Open your eyes and look.

00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:01.296
Mr. KATRINA WANGRARENG.
BORN IN 2004.
Open your eyes and look.

00:32:02.020 --> 00:32:04.392
I was born in 2004.

00:32:04.416 --> 00:32:06.712
I held back a year in kindergarten.

00:32:06.736 --> 00:32:08.616
I received a school suspension
when I was in 6th grade.

00:32:08.648 --> 00:32:10.480
I wanted to be a top student.

00:32:10.528 --> 00:32:12.480
So I repeated Grade 9.

00:32:13.408 --> 00:32:15.410
What the hell are you doing?

00:32:15.456 --> 00:32:16.768
Go back and do the dishes.

00:32:16.816 --> 00:32:17.872
Go do the dishes, Kat.

00:32:17.888 --> 00:32:19.008
Stop drinking.

00:32:19.040 --> 00:32:21.784
Kat!

00:32:28.370 --> 00:32:29.544
Kat!

00:32:58.170 --> 00:33:00.000
(My prince.)

00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:00.928
(My prince.)

00:33:18.930 --> 00:33:22.408
Kat, why are you dancing alone?

00:33:22.860 --> 00:33:23.848
Don’t you feel lonely?

00:33:26.360 --> 00:33:28.016
You are asking me that.

00:33:28.040 --> 00:33:29.432
Do you have special feelings for me?

00:33:40.672 --> 00:33:41.688
P’Pat.

00:33:42.570 --> 00:33:43.416
Let’s dance.

00:34:21.340 --> 00:34:24.536
Nevia, I told you
not to dim the light in the room.

00:34:25.020 --> 00:34:27.416
P’Pat just grabbed anyone near him
without looking.

00:35:09.540 --> 00:35:11.080
What happened to your face?

00:35:11.112 --> 00:35:13.240
Kat threw up on my face.

00:35:14.760 --> 00:35:17.472
Your face is so stinky.

00:35:21.670 --> 00:35:22.784
Shit.

00:35:22.816 --> 00:35:23.504
What?

00:35:23.950 --> 00:35:24.744
Our performance.

00:35:25.940 --> 00:35:26.896
Come on.

00:35:27.970 --> 00:35:28.560
Kat.

00:35:34.576 --> 00:35:35.720
Kat.

00:35:36.208 --> 00:35:37.408
This is embarrassing.

00:35:40.160 --> 00:35:41.024
Come here

00:36:04.888 --> 00:36:05.880

don’t disrespect her.)

don’t disrespect her.)

(I used to think that
my success was determined by my actions.)

00:38:03.264 --> 00:38:04.928
(But actually,)

00:38:05.450 --> 00:38:07.864
(it’s up to the divine power.)

00:38:07.896 --> 00:38:10.888
(She is the one
who helps us get where we are today.)

00:38:15.220 --> 00:38:19.904
(Today, the one I am most thankful for is…)

00:38:19.928 --> 00:38:21.520
Goddess Dalop.

00:38:25.290 --> 00:38:26.160
Kat!

00:38:26.736 --> 00:38:28.740
When did you get the goddess’s photo?

00:38:28.768 --> 00:38:30.040
Get down, Kat.

00:38:30.580 --> 00:38:31.808
Kat, put the photo down.

00:38:31.832 --> 00:38:32.712
No.

00:38:33.940 --> 00:38:36.008
I want to express my gratitude to her

00:38:37.352 --> 00:38:38.912
with my own words.

00:38:40.540 --> 00:38:43.624
Goddess, thank you so much

00:38:44.650 --> 00:38:46.472
for helping me get where I am today.

00:38:47.290 --> 00:38:48.856
I’m so happy.

00:38:52.200 --> 00:38:53.816
All of you.

00:38:54.590 --> 00:38:57.024
Keep this in mind.

00:38:57.064 --> 00:38:58.120
This is…

00:39:02.020 --> 00:39:02.824
Goddess

00:39:04.520 --> 00:39:05.608
Kat, no.

00:39:05.648 --> 00:39:06.704
Swallow it.

00:39:10.790 --> 00:39:11.848
This is…

00:39:12.150 --> 00:39:12.672
Kat.

00:39:13.780 --> 00:39:14.672
Goddess

00:39:15.430 --> 00:39:16.304
Da…

00:39:39.290 --> 00:39:40.704
Goddess.

00:39:41.100 --> 00:39:43.584
We are so sorry.

00:39:44.260 --> 00:39:47.016
I know that my friend is an idiot.

00:39:47.900 --> 00:39:50.664
But I never thought she was this stupid.

00:39:57.260 --> 00:40:00.000
Do you think the goddess will be mad at us?

00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:00.720
Do you think the goddess will be mad at us?

00:40:01.720 --> 00:40:03.720
I’m not sure.

00:40:03.760 --> 00:40:06.616
But we didn’t do anything wrong.

00:40:06.740 --> 00:40:07.624
Yeah.

00:40:08.070 --> 00:40:08.928
That’s right.

00:40:09.136 --> 00:40:10.624
She won’t be mad at us.

00:40:10.672 --> 00:40:13.080
If she is mad, she can take it out on Kat.

00:40:17.248 --> 00:40:19.328
Is she having a nightmare?

00:40:19.640 --> 00:40:20.432
What’s wrong with her?

00:40:20.860 --> 00:40:22.640
She looks like she’s having an epileptic seizure.

00:40:22.672 --> 00:40:23.208
Kat.

00:40:29.600 --> 00:40:31.056
You finally woke up, bitch.

00:40:37.904 --> 00:40:38.820
What are you doing?

00:40:44.520 --> 00:40:45.808
I’m not your friend.

00:40:52.630 --> 00:40:53.600
I’m…

00:40:53.624 --> 00:40:54.528
the…

00:40:55.380 --> 00:40:55.944
…goddess!

00:41:05.690 --> 00:41:06.376
Wait.

00:41:07.100 --> 00:41:08.600
What are you screaming for?

00:41:33.128 --> 00:41:34.448
She’s gone.

00:41:36.328 --> 00:41:37.152
Kat.

00:41:37.176 --> 00:41:38.360
Stop acting nonsense.

00:41:40.060 --> 00:41:41.896
The goddess has possessed your friend.

00:41:43.730 --> 00:41:46.376
Your life will be full of misfortune.

00:41:46.408 --> 00:41:48.144
If someone tells us we have bad luck,

00:41:48.160 --> 00:41:50.064
we will only focus on it.

00:41:50.950 --> 00:41:52.072
Shit.

00:41:54.480 --> 00:41:55.800
Nevia, wait.

00:41:57.280 --> 00:42:00.000
You need to find three magic items.

00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:00.296
You need to find three magic items.

00:42:00.320 --> 00:42:03.896
Then you can permanently take Kat’s body.
