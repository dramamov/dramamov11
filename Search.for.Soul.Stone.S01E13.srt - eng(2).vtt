00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:58.280
What a pity.

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:36.920
Despicable.

00:01:37.719 --> 00:01:39.159
If you dare, show yourself
and fight me.

00:01:39.959 --> 00:01:40.799
What?

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:43.159
So using my Power is despicable,

00:01:43.599 --> 00:01:44.239
but using a gun

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:45.760
is considered fair?

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:47.000
Jerk.

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:50.200
You jerk.

00:01:50.799 --> 00:01:51.879
Let go of me!

00:01:53.879 --> 00:01:54.879
Jerk, let go of me!

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:00.200
Miss, let's go!

00:02:33.879 --> 00:02:34.360
Ade.

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:35.520
Ade.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:41.919
They...

00:02:42.879 --> 00:02:45.080
When the gang was slaughtered,

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:48.840
I couldn't

00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:51.960
help my brothers.

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:55.960
I brought shame to the gang.

00:02:57.719 --> 00:02:59.520
I'm going down.

00:03:00.479 --> 00:03:04.000
They won't blame me, right?

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:08.520
No.

00:03:09.639 --> 00:03:10.360
No.

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:38.639
Meng Yan.

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:40.080
Can you hear me?

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:43.080
What's going on over there?

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:44.280
I'm fine.

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:48.479
Ade is dead.

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:55.759
By the way, Meng Yan,

00:03:56.159 --> 00:03:57.680
why couldn't I hear you just now?

00:03:58.599 --> 00:03:59.479
I don't know.

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:02.000
My Power suddenly vanished.

00:04:02.479 --> 00:04:03.360
How is that possible?

00:04:05.879 --> 00:04:06.680
I think

00:04:07.319 --> 00:04:08.400
there's something in this factory

00:04:08.719 --> 00:04:10.439
we don't know about.

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:17.720
Meng Yan.

00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:19.279
It seems there are others here

00:04:19.279 --> 00:04:20.120
besides us.

00:04:22.279 --> 00:04:22.680
Yuyan.

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:24.160
Yuyan.

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:40.839
So that's it.

00:04:44.439 --> 00:04:45.519
So that's what?

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:49.199
No wonder, with my father's Power,

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:51.800
he was defeated by you all.

00:04:53.639 --> 00:04:54.480
Explain further.

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:00.480
I guess

00:05:01.839 --> 00:05:02.600
your Power

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:05.759
is to make nearby Powers disappear.

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:07.040
Is that right?

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:09.600
I just want everyone

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:11.800
to start on equal footing.

00:05:13.399 --> 00:05:14.879
The same starting line.

00:05:16.399 --> 00:05:18.480
You turn Power users into regular people,

00:05:19.279 --> 00:05:21.120
then outnumber them to win.

00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:23.079
If a Power user

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:24.399
loses their Power,

00:05:24.399 --> 00:05:25.639
they're helpless.

00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:28.399
How is that different from being useless?

00:05:31.439 --> 00:05:32.240
Looks like

00:05:33.319 --> 00:05:34.160
everything today

00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:36.040
was all part of your plan.

00:05:37.639 --> 00:05:38.800
I think

00:05:39.199 --> 00:05:39.920
the mind

00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:42.040
is the strongest Power.

00:05:42.399 --> 00:05:44.079
The Azure Dragon Gang had no grudge with you.

00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:46.319
Why did you kill them?

00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:48.279
They were in my way.

00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:50.800
Whenever I'm in a good mood

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:52.319
and want to do something,

00:05:53.079 --> 00:05:55.399
they run around in front of me.

00:05:55.399 --> 00:05:56.600
Running around.

00:05:57.519 --> 00:05:59.680
Or just show up in my sight.

00:06:01.079 --> 00:06:03.399
I can't help but want to catch them.

00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:04.519
Kick them one by one.

00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:05.920
Kick them one by one.

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.199
Just thinking about it feels great.

00:06:14.759 --> 00:06:16.959
If your Power is so strong,

00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:19.800
why wait until now to act?

00:06:21.839 --> 00:06:23.399
Because my uncle

00:06:23.399 --> 00:06:26.040
taught me to forgive others.

00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:31.680
Or...

00:06:32.639 --> 00:06:33.800
your Power

00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:36.480
must have some fatal flaws.

00:06:37.639 --> 00:06:38.439
Oh?

00:06:39.040 --> 00:06:39.839
Let's hear it.

00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:43.040
Your first flaw

00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:44.519
is range.

00:06:45.759 --> 00:06:46.800
Your range

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:49.199
probably only covers the factory.

00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:53.040
No.

00:06:53.639 --> 00:06:54.439
That's not right.

00:06:55.639 --> 00:06:57.639
It might not even cover this hall.

00:07:00.040 --> 00:07:01.240
Your second flaw

00:07:01.800 --> 00:07:02.839
is time.

00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:05.399
To use your Power,

00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:08.120
you need some time to activate it.

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:10.480
Otherwise, with your personality,

00:07:11.279 --> 00:07:12.680
you wouldn't have waited this long.

00:07:15.240 --> 00:07:16.040
Of course,

00:07:16.720 --> 00:07:18.240
as the Shen family's heir,

00:07:19.079 --> 00:07:20.800
to fix these two flaws,

00:07:21.319 --> 00:07:23.480
you can use your people and money.

00:07:24.519 --> 00:07:26.160
Now, your third flaw.

00:07:27.199 --> 00:07:28.319
Because of this,

00:07:28.839 --> 00:07:30.560
you split the three of us up.

00:07:30.560 --> 00:07:31.639
Especially Jia Yuer.

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:34.680
What are you most afraid of now?

00:07:36.800 --> 00:07:37.600
That's right.

00:07:38.240 --> 00:07:39.040
It's guns.

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:40.519
Yuer.

00:07:45.560 --> 00:07:46.079
Hey.

00:07:46.800 --> 00:07:47.240
Can you hear me?

00:07:48.399 --> 00:07:49.240
What happened just now?

00:07:50.240 --> 00:07:51.120
No time to explain.

00:07:51.399 --> 00:07:51.959
Meet at the corridor.

00:07:52.279 --> 00:07:52.759
Hurry!

00:07:54.040 --> 00:07:55.000
What's happening on your side?

00:07:55.720 --> 00:07:57.040
There seem to be others here.

00:07:57.560 --> 00:07:58.279
Not from the Shen family.

00:07:58.279 --> 00:07:58.839
He helped me.

00:07:59.279 --> 00:08:00.199
What do we do now?

00:08:00.680 --> 00:08:01.600
Let's get out first.

00:08:09.759 --> 00:08:11.040
We can't get out.

00:08:18.720 --> 00:08:19.920
Meng Yan, oh Meng Yan,

00:08:20.600 --> 00:08:21.839
aren't you good at running?

00:08:22.480 --> 00:08:23.800
Now I want to see

00:08:24.360 --> 00:08:25.720
how you'll escape.

00:08:29.839 --> 00:08:30.680
Shen Jingshi.

00:08:31.800 --> 00:08:33.240
What grudge do you have against me?

00:08:34.399 --> 00:08:36.519
Why wipe out my Azure Dragon Gang?

00:08:40.240 --> 00:08:41.679
It's not like I meant to.

00:08:41.679 --> 00:08:43.000
My condolences.

00:08:44.320 --> 00:08:45.919
My men are all rough.

00:08:46.399 --> 00:08:48.639
They made a mess of your gang.

00:08:49.080 --> 00:08:50.600
Didn't even clean up after.

00:08:50.919 --> 00:08:52.840
Sorry about that.

00:08:58.120 --> 00:08:58.799
Yuer.

00:09:03.960 --> 00:09:04.440
Yuer.

00:09:11.279 --> 00:09:12.000
How is that possible?

00:09:14.720 --> 00:09:16.159
Controlling a Power user's Power...

00:09:17.039 --> 00:09:18.799
That's Shen Jingshi's Power.

00:09:37.799 --> 00:09:38.759
I never expected this.

00:09:39.399 --> 00:09:41.919
I actually lost to a kid.

00:09:44.840 --> 00:09:45.639
Meng Yan

00:09:46.080 --> 00:09:47.639
The look on your face now

00:09:47.799 --> 00:09:50.240
is just like your father's back then.

00:09:54.080 --> 00:09:55.480
You bastard.

00:09:57.200 --> 00:09:58.000
Let go.

00:09:59.440 --> 00:10:00.240
Let go.

00:10:04.240 --> 00:10:06.120
The Meng family couldn't beat us before.

00:10:06.799 --> 00:10:10.200
Now and in the future, it's the same.

00:10:11.799 --> 00:10:13.600
If the heads of the Tang and Jia families

00:10:13.799 --> 00:10:15.240
knew you were so rude to us,

00:10:15.720 --> 00:10:16.440
Shen Jingshi

00:10:17.159 --> 00:10:18.440
do you know what would happen?

00:10:19.200 --> 00:10:19.879
I...

00:10:20.320 --> 00:10:22.240
I wasn't rude to your families.

00:10:22.639 --> 00:10:23.240
Besides,

00:10:23.840 --> 00:10:24.600
who saw it?

00:10:25.200 --> 00:10:26.240
Did you see it?

00:10:26.639 --> 00:10:28.000
Or did you see it?

00:10:29.840 --> 00:10:30.600
But,

00:10:31.360 --> 00:10:32.879
there are no secrets that last forever.

00:10:33.840 --> 00:10:34.799
Dead people

00:10:35.559 --> 00:10:37.639
keep secrets best.

00:11:23.679 --> 00:11:24.120
Xiao Duo

00:11:55.399 --> 00:11:57.840
Why can't my power suppress her?

00:11:58.519 --> 00:11:59.240
Xiao Duo

00:12:13.360 --> 00:12:14.320
Xiao Duo

00:12:22.840 --> 00:12:24.440
Brother
