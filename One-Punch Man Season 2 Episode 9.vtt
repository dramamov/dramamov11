<b>More like some puny runt 
out to make a name for himself!</b>

02:09.810 --> 02:14.190
The Troubles of the Strongest

02:09.810 --> 02:14.190
The Troubles of the Strongest

02:10.240 --> 02:11.450
<b>Pathetic!</b>

02:11.450 --> 02:14.190
<b>You have no idea how outclassed you are, small fry!</b>

02:14.680 --> 02:15.820
<b>You're nothing but...</b>

02:16.170 --> 02:17.040
<b>You're...</b>

02:21.540 --> 02:23.200
<b>Wait, do I know you?</b>

02:23.200 --> 02:24.200
<b>Have we met?</b>

02:24.200 --> 02:25.200
<b>Shut your face!</b>

02:25.730 --> 02:28.880
<b>This time, Bakuzan the Monster</b>

02:28.880 --> 02:31.580
<b>will rain down upon you a buffet of death blows!</b>

02:32.020 --> 02:35.710
<b>Art of the Darkness Hell Killer:
 Demon Sweeper Low Kick!</b>

02:41.130 --> 02:42.180
<b>He got you guys, too...</b>

02:42.930 --> 02:45.930
<b>That you're still standing is impressive,</b>

02:45.930 --> 02:49.690
<b>but by now you've realized the
 unimaginable difference in our strength.</b>

02:50.370 --> 02:52.310
<b>Bear Killer Mid Kick!</b>

02:54.210 --> 02:56.920
<b><i>Is he protecting the injured?</i></b>

02:56.920 --> 02:58.860
<b>P-Protect yourself first!</b>

02:58.860 --> 03:00.910
<b>Carnage Punch!</b>

03:03.410 --> 03:07.870
<b>You've got one last chance
 to apologize for our match!</b>

03:09.830 --> 03:12.040
<b>Tch! This guy's no fun.</b>

03:12.040 --> 03:13.790
<b>He must have gone into shock.</b>

03:13.790 --> 03:15.340
<b>Time to end this!</b>

03:15.340 --> 03:18.050
<b>Those scrawny nothings have to go too!</b>

03:18.050 --> 03:19.760
<b>Hellbringin' Hand Chop!</b>

03:20.160 --> 03:21.380
<b>Darn, I just can't remember.</b>

03:27.310 --> 03:29.460
<b>Who was this guy?</b>

03:29.460 --> 03:30.420
<b>Eh, whatever.</b>

03:34.440 --> 03:37.210
<b>That really sucked for you.</b>

03:37.210 --> 03:38.530
<b>Right after you'd won, too.</b>

03:39.400 --> 03:42.860
<b>Well, I defeated the monsters,
 so maybe next time won't be so bad.</b>

03:42.860 --> 03:44.660
<b>Okay, yeah...</b>

03:44.660 --> 03:46.740
<b>Thank you for saving me...</b>

03:47.590 --> 03:50.460
<b>Wh-Who are you, really?</b>

03:51.340 --> 03:53.080
<b>I'm Saitama.</b>

03:53.080 --> 03:53.920
<b>A hero.</b>

03:54.290 --> 03:55.640
<b>Saitama?</b>

03:55.640 --> 03:58.880
<b>So you fought in the tournament under an alias?</b>

03:59.240 --> 04:00.400
<b><i>Uh... oops.</i></b>

04:00.400 --> 04:03.410
<b>What were you doing here?</b>

04:03.410 --> 04:06.120
<b>Was this all some plan of the Hero Association's?</b>

04:06.120 --> 04:06.940
<b>No.</b>

04:06.940 --> 04:08.770
<b>I wanted to experience martial arts.</b>

04:09.470 --> 04:10.680
<b>And win the prize money.</b>

04:11.580 --> 04:14.150
<b>There's this guy calling himself a "Hero Hunter".</b>

04:14.800 --> 04:17.020
<b>They say he's a martial arts master,</b>

04:17.390 --> 04:19.450
<b>so I sort of got interested.</b>

04:19.450 --> 04:20.490
<b>I see.</b>

04:20.490 --> 04:22.450
<b>You were looking for ways to counter him?</b>

04:22.450 --> 04:25.030
<b>Well, I wouldn't exactly say that.</b>

04:26.010 --> 04:28.610
<b>I just happened across an entry ticket.</b>

04:28.610 --> 04:30.290
<b>More specifically...</b>

04:32.070 --> 04:33.250
<b>I was bored.</b>

04:34.070 --> 04:35.580
<b>You were bored?</b>

04:35.580 --> 04:39.050
<b>Thanks to you, though, I'm still alive.</b>

04:39.050 --> 04:41.450
<b>Sorry I didn't get here sooner.</b>

04:41.450 --> 04:42.470
<b>Saitama!</b>

04:43.800 --> 04:46.010
<b>You shouldn't go out there.</b>

04:46.010 --> 04:50.260
<b>Some dangerous group called the
 "Monster Association" is on a rampage outside.</b>

04:50.720 --> 04:51.390
<b>You serious?</b>

04:51.390 --> 04:52.400
<b>Yeah.</b>

04:52.400 --> 04:55.900
<b>Seems they're able to turn humans into monsters.</b>

04:56.580 --> 04:58.520
<b>That guy you just beat, Bakuzan, was one of them.</b>

04:58.870 --> 05:00.780
<b>Remember, from your second match?</b>

05:01.250 --> 05:03.000
<b>So that's who he was?</b>

05:03.000 --> 05:06.410
<b>I mean, I can't remember every opponent I punch.</b>

05:06.410 --> 05:09.380
<b>Anyway, it's dangerous right now,</b>

05:09.380 --> 05:11.430
<b>so we should lay low.</b>

05:11.430 --> 05:13.500
<b>Gouketsu is still somewhere nearby.</b>

05:14.070 --> 05:15.310
<b>Gouketsu?</b>

05:15.310 --> 05:16.070
<b>Yeah.</b>

05:16.070 --> 05:18.170
<b>He's another monster I'd avoid.</b>

05:18.870 --> 05:22.380
<b>Nothing I could do had any effect on him.</b>

05:23.410 --> 05:25.550
<b>That kind of strength should be illegal.</b>

05:28.180 --> 05:31.010
<b><i>When my repairs are done I must return at once.</i></b>

05:31.010 --> 05:34.270
<b><i>Even if he caught me off-guard,
 a monster that can beat me with one punch</i></b>

05:35.580 --> 05:37.480
<b><i>must not be allowed to survive.</i></b>

05:37.960 --> 05:41.320
<b><i>I need to gather the Class S 
heroes and Master Saitama,</i></b>

05:41.850 --> 05:43.400
<b><i>then strike together!</i></b>

05:44.300 --> 05:45.900
<b>So he's that strong?</b>

05:45.900 --> 05:48.550
<b>Even with the most meticulous preparation,</b>

05:48.550 --> 05:50.310
<b>who knows if he can be beat?</b>

05:50.310 --> 05:51.030
<b>I see.</b>

05:51.950 --> 05:53.910
<b>So, where'd this monster go?</b>

05:54.270 --> 05:55.160
<b>What?</b>

05:55.160 --> 05:56.160
<b>That way, but...</b>

05:56.640 --> 05:57.730
<b>Oh...</b>

05:57.730 --> 05:59.540
<b>So all that noise earlier was him, huh?</b>

06:00.370 --> 06:01.220
<b>I'll check it out.</b>

06:01.220 --> 06:01.790
<b>What?</b>

06:01.790 --> 06:03.290
<b>No!</b>

06:03.290 --> 06:05.170
<b>Weren't you listening? I'm trying to warn you!</b>

06:06.030 --> 06:07.800
<b>I heard you. And?</b>

06:07.800 --> 06:09.640
<b>You still don't get it!</b>

06:09.930 --> 06:13.130
<b>He was once a preeminent martial artist.</b>

06:13.130 --> 06:15.600
<b>He's no ordinary fighter! You'll be killed for sure!</b>

06:15.600 --> 06:18.330
<b>Whoa, a master of martial arts, eh?</b>

06:18.330 --> 06:19.310
<b>Perfect.</b>

06:19.310 --> 06:20.730
<b>Might make a decent fight.</b>

06:21.690 --> 06:22.990
<b>H-Hey...</b>

06:22.990 --> 06:24.380
<b>You're injured.</b>

06:24.380 --> 06:25.360
<b>Take it easy.</b>

06:25.360 --> 06:26.980
<b>I'm not letting go.</b>

06:26.980 --> 06:29.840
<b>I won't let you throw your life 
away when I owe you mine!</b>

06:49.630 --> 06:51.220
<b>I couldn't stop him!</b>

06:55.850 --> 07:01.140
<b>I finally saw what a hero, a true hero, can be!</b>

07:01.920 --> 07:04.310
<b>He shouldn't die now.</b>

07:04.310 --> 07:08.610
<b>He's destined to save many, many more people.</b>

07:20.250 --> 07:21.370
<b>Oh, by the way,</b>

07:21.710 --> 07:23.960
<b>there's something I forgot to mention.</b>

07:24.320 --> 07:27.120
<b>That thing about me lying 
to get into the tournament...</b>

07:27.120 --> 07:28.340
<b>Could we keep it a secret?</b>

07:31.670 --> 07:33.980
<b>Was Gouketsu tough?</b>

07:33.980 --> 07:35.180
<b>Hmm...</b>

07:35.180 --> 07:37.680
<b>When they only take one punch,
 it's kinda hard to compare.</b>

07:38.640 --> 07:40.880
<b>I want to ask you something.</b>

07:40.880 --> 07:41.930
<b>Yeah?</b>

07:41.930 --> 07:45.100
<b>I don't know if I can overcome my fear,</b>

07:45.100 --> 07:46.900
<b>but I'd like to try.</b>

07:47.300 --> 07:49.990
<b>Do you think I could become... a hero?</b>

07:50.320 --> 07:50.950
<b>No idea.</b>

07:50.950 --> 07:51.800
<b>Huh?</b>

07:52.460 --> 07:53.320
<b>But, you know...</b>

07:54.210 --> 07:56.910
<b>If I became one, maybe anyone can?</b>

07:57.840 --> 08:00.080
<b>It's natural to be afraid at the start.</b>

08:00.400 --> 08:03.240
<b>Before I got excessively strong, I was afraid too.</b>

08:04.090 --> 08:05.960
<b>A hero who's excessively strong?</b>

08:06.770 --> 08:08.340
<b>Doesn't sound too bad.</b>

08:09.390 --> 08:12.180
<b>Can I ask you another question, Saitama?</b>

08:12.180 --> 08:12.550
<b>Sure.</b>

08:13.620 --> 08:14.930
<b>Could I be your disciple?</b>

08:17.670 --> 08:19.030
<b>Absolutely not.</b>

08:21.550 --> 08:22.830
<b><i>Damn it...</i></b>

08:22.830 --> 08:25.060
<b><i>His whole body's covered in spikes.</i></b>

08:25.060 --> 08:26.800
<b><i>How do I fight him?</i></b>

08:27.270 --> 08:30.580
<b>Prisoner! Don't use your hands!</b>

08:28.450 --> 08:29.610
<b>Use your ball and chain!</b>

08:30.580 --> 08:32.860
<b>Yeah, nail him with your chain!</b>

08:34.010 --> 08:36.860
<b>Thank you for the enthusiastic
 support, young people!</b>

08:36.860 --> 08:40.910
<b>Later I'll shower you with kisses of gratitude, 
but for now evacuate the rooftop!</b>

08:41.260 --> 08:43.810
<b>It's no good, he can't hear us.</b>

08:43.810 --> 08:46.540
<b>Does he <i>have to</i> fight completely naked?</b>

08:47.090 --> 08:51.090
<b>You fresh-faced boys cheering me on
 without regard for your own safety...</b>

08:51.090 --> 08:53.050
<b>Your love will not go unrewarded!</b>

08:53.710 --> 08:55.010
<b>Ah! Love!</b>

08:55.840 --> 08:58.310
<b>That's it... That's the answer.</b>

08:58.310 --> 09:01.770
<b>I can accept the pain with love so deep...</b>

09:02.810 --> 09:04.730
<b>...there will be nothing left to fear!</b>

09:07.100 --> 09:09.150
<b>Angel Hug...!</b>

09:15.740 --> 09:18.870
<b>He keeps staring at us... with blood all over him.</b>

09:20.950 --> 09:23.120
<b>Hello? Puri-Puri Prisoner speaking.</b>

09:24.050 --> 09:24.580
<b>What?</b>

09:25.210 --> 09:28.920
<b>It broke into my comfy cozy 
home and stole my honeys?!</b>

09:29.660 --> 09:31.550
<b>Where is this monster now?</b>

09:32.900 --> 09:33.960
<b>They're gone?</b>

09:33.630 --> 09:39.010
{=1}<b>Water</b>

09:33.630 --> 09:39.010
{=0}<b>Water</b>

09:34.810 --> 09:35.630
<b>Yeah...</b>

09:35.630 --> 09:38.510
<b>They all left together... maybe 30 minutes ago.</b>

09:39.010 --> 09:43.310
<b>They came all at once,
 went wild, then left all at once?</b>

09:44.120 --> 09:46.020
<b>What were they up to?</b>

09:46.700 --> 09:47.850
<b><i>Damn it.</i></b>

09:47.850 --> 09:50.210
<b><i>How'd I miss such a huge disaster?</i></b>

09:50.210 --> 09:52.850
<b><i>The other heroes were out here fighting.</i></b>

09:52.850 --> 09:53.980
<b><i>What was I thinking?</i></b>

09:54.630 --> 09:57.390
<b><i>I can't call myself a hero if I don't defeat monsters.</i></b>

09:59.260 --> 10:00.160
<b><i>Wait a sec...</i></b>

10:00.910 --> 10:05.120
<b><i>I don't fight monsters because 
I want to be called a hero.</i></b>

10:05.830 --> 10:09.120
<b><i>I might have forgotten something important.</i></b>

10:09.120 --> 10:11.630
<b><i>Like the reason why I became a hero...</i></b>

10:12.490 --> 10:15.580
<b><i>I started out just having fun.</i></b>

10:15.580 --> 10:20.170
<b><i>But since joining the Hero Association,
 I've been so bored.</i></b>

10:20.970 --> 10:24.050
<b><i>That "hero hunter" guy got me curious again.</i></b>

10:24.050 --> 10:27.150
<b><i>That's why I entered the martial arts tournament.</i></b>

10:28.400 --> 10:29.270
<b><i>But...</i></b>

10:29.680 --> 10:32.250
<b><i>Against Suiryu and the others,</i></b>

10:32.250 --> 10:35.310
<b><i>even a monster who was a master martial artist</i></b>

10:35.310 --> 10:37.210
<b><i>I didn't really feel anything.</i></b>

10:37.950 --> 10:39.740
<b><i>And I didn't get anything out of it.</i></b>

10:40.940 --> 10:42.340
<b>Saitama?</b>

10:45.020 --> 10:46.330
<b>King?</b>

10:47.900 --> 10:50.130
<b>You sure it's safe to be out here?</b>

10:50.130 --> 10:51.160
<b>Well,</b>

10:51.160 --> 10:55.250
<b>I heard the alarms, but it's all quiet now.</b>

10:55.670 --> 10:58.140
<b>Why're you looking so down?</b>

10:58.140 --> 11:00.760
<b>You know... Got a lot on my mind.</b>

11:01.270 --> 11:02.410
<b>I get it.</b>

11:02.410 --> 11:05.140
<b>But you're still young, so you can't give up.</b>

11:05.670 --> 11:06.520
<b>King...</b>

11:07.020 --> 11:09.580
<b>Besides, it might grow back.</b>

11:09.580 --> 11:10.560
<b>And there's treatmentsâ€”</b>

11:10.560 --> 11:11.570
<b>Wait, hold on!</b>

11:11.570 --> 11:13.400
<b>That's not what I'm talking about!</b>

11:14.010 --> 11:16.020
<b>It's more of a big picture thing.</b>

11:16.020 --> 11:18.400
<b>Being down isn't like you.</b>

11:18.400 --> 11:20.600
<b>You're always so strong.</b>

11:20.600 --> 11:24.100
<b>Well, I'm not going to be getting any stronger.</b>

11:24.100 --> 11:24.840
<b>What?</b>

11:24.840 --> 11:27.040
<b>I've become <i>too</i> strong.</b>

11:27.680 --> 11:30.370
<b>No matter who I fight, I don't feel anything.</b>

11:30.370 --> 11:31.960
<b>I gain nothing from it.</b>

11:32.610 --> 11:35.130
<b>There's nothing I can learn from anyone.</b>

11:35.130 --> 11:39.590
<b>But isn't having that much strength really awesome?</b>

11:40.030 --> 11:41.310
<b>King...</b>

11:41.310 --> 11:43.550
<b>Not having any room to grow</b>

11:43.550 --> 11:47.060
<b>means that I can't enjoy the process of growing.</b>

11:48.530 --> 11:50.270
<b>No matter how many monsters I defeat,</b>

11:51.090 --> 11:54.100
<b>on the inside, I'm bored out of my mind.</b>

11:56.890 --> 11:59.650
<b>I never thought being a hero could be so lonesome.</b>

11:59.650 --> 12:02.410
<b>You feel lonely, Saitama?</b>

12:02.410 --> 12:03.340
<b>Guess so.</b>

12:03.340 --> 12:07.370
<b>There's a ballroom dance school 
near the station you could check out.</b>

12:07.370 --> 12:08.900
<b>Why would I do that?</b>

12:08.900 --> 12:11.410
<b>If you're lonely, you could make friends.</b>

12:11.410 --> 12:14.540
<b>No, that's not quite what I mean.</b>

12:14.540 --> 12:15.040
<b>Then what?</b>

12:15.330 --> 12:17.130
<b>It's hard to explain...</b>

12:17.130 --> 12:18.590
<b>I'm not interested,</b>

12:18.590 --> 12:20.980
<b>and I don't have much time these days.</b>

12:20.980 --> 12:24.430
<b>Once things settle down,
 what about a trip to change things up?</b>

12:24.850 --> 12:26.170
<b>A trip?</b>

12:26.170 --> 12:27.300
<b>Hmm...</b>

12:27.300 --> 12:29.140
<b>There's no place I particularly want to go...</b>

12:30.480 --> 12:31.350
<b>Good grief...</b>

12:32.120 --> 12:34.470
<b>You're bored and want some excitement,</b>

12:34.470 --> 12:37.640
<b>but you won't take on any challenges.</b>

12:37.640 --> 12:40.440
<b>There was a time I felt that way too.</b>

12:40.750 --> 12:42.410
<b>Listen to me, Saitama.</b>

12:42.410 --> 12:44.910
<b>Life is a journey to nowhere.</b>

12:44.910 --> 12:49.350
<b>If you want a change of scenery, 
you need to find your own way there.</b>

12:49.350 --> 12:51.000
<b>You sure you've been on a trip before?</b>

12:51.530 --> 12:57.810
<b>Saitama, seems to me you're mistaking 
getting strong for reaching your destination.</b>

12:57.810 --> 13:02.720
<b>I doubt the path of becoming a hero ends so easily.</b>

13:03.850 --> 13:07.090
<b>Is this a lecture? 
It's not like you're some veteran hero.</b>

13:07.930 --> 13:12.060
<b>It's inherently wrong to seek
 satisfaction from fighting.</b>

13:12.630 --> 13:15.940
<b>Battling with great courage and benefiting society.</b>

13:15.940 --> 13:18.400
<b>Isn't that what gives a hero's existence meaning?</b>

13:18.400 --> 13:20.270
<b><i>King's talking sense?!</i></b>

13:20.720 --> 13:26.450
<b>In that respect, you've got a long road to walk 
before you can truly become the ultimate hero.</b>

13:26.890 --> 13:28.320
<b>That's true!</b>

13:28.320 --> 13:31.870
<b>In other words, the pursuit of the ideal remains.</b>

13:31.870 --> 13:36.040
<b>You must still have a great
 deal of unrealized potential.</b>

13:36.040 --> 13:37.930
<b>And in that case,</b>

13:37.930 --> 13:40.870
<b>to say that you've reached the limit of your growth</b>

13:40.870 --> 13:43.710
<b>starts to sound shallow and arrogant, doesn't it?</b>

13:44.020 --> 13:45.220
<b><i>King...</i></b>

13:46.910 --> 13:50.440
<b>What does it take to be the "ultimate hero"?</b>

13:50.440 --> 13:52.910
<b>An unflinching sense of justice? Prowess in combat?</b>

13:52.910 --> 13:55.300
<b>The courage to face any hardship?</b>

13:55.300 --> 13:57.900
<b>Until you've found the answer to that question,</b>

13:58.300 --> 14:00.480
<b>how can you say you have time to feel bored?</b>

14:01.430 --> 14:04.110
<b>Those are my thoughts, anyway.</b>

14:04.110 --> 14:05.690
<b><i>Plus I read it in a manga.</i></b>

14:06.070 --> 14:07.900
<b>That just blew my mind.</b>

14:09.200 --> 14:11.660
<b><i>The "ultimate hero"?</i></b>

14:11.660 --> 14:14.350
<b><i>Should I be thinking about what that truly means?</i></b>

14:15.510 --> 14:18.260
<b>I think it'd make me even more bored.</b>

14:18.260 --> 14:21.290
<b>If you're that bored, wanna come play games?</b>

14:21.290 --> 14:24.540
<b>No, that's totally not what I'm feeling right now.</b>

14:24.540 --> 14:26.770
<b>I'm numb and nothing'll change it.</b>

14:26.770 --> 14:29.160
<b>Don't be like that. Let's do it.</b>

14:29.160 --> 14:30.980
<b>Always winning gets boring, right?</b>

14:30.980 --> 14:32.620
<b>So I'll let you lose.</b>

14:33.490 --> 14:35.170
<b>You can't trick me.</b>

14:35.170 --> 14:39.400
<b>Anyway, I wouldn't get upset 
just because I lost some game.</b>

14:39.400 --> 14:42.090
<b>It takes more than that to work me up.</b>

14:42.090 --> 14:43.900
<b>Yeah? Okay.</b>

14:44.210 --> 14:47.860
<b>Tell you what. As a handicap, 
I'll play with just one finger from each hand.</b>

14:47.860 --> 14:49.100
<b>Okay, jerkoff!</b>

14:49.100 --> 14:51.240
<b>I'm so gonna crush your ass this time!</b>

14:54.390 --> 14:56.660
<b><i>I never thought it'd be him that beat me.</i></b>

14:59.590 --> 15:03.960
<b><i>His speed and power were 
far beyond my expectations.</i></b>

15:04.450 --> 15:06.670
<b><i>I was lucky to even get away.</i></b>

15:06.670 --> 15:13.220
<b><i>Martial arts designed for human opponents were 
a poor match against his four-legged fighting style.</i></b>

15:13.220 --> 15:15.180
<b><i>That was a good lesson.</i></b>

15:16.890 --> 15:19.070
<b><i>This is the freaking best!</i></b>

15:19.070 --> 15:21.650
<b><i>I can become so much stronger!</i></b>

15:22.960 --> 15:23.610
<b><i>Huh?</i></b>

15:24.000 --> 15:24.980
<b><i>That's...</i></b>

15:25.650 --> 15:27.150
<b><i>Yeah, that's him.</i></b>

15:27.950 --> 15:30.030
<b><i>I won't get a second chance.</i></b>

15:30.790 --> 15:33.510
<b><i>My body can handle it, and the pain is gone.</i></b>

15:33.510 --> 15:36.700
<b><i>In fact, I'm so stoked I feel full up with power!</i></b>

15:37.040 --> 15:39.580
<b><i>King, it's your turn to be hunted!</i></b>

15:40.500 --> 15:44.540
<b><i>What will his move be when he reacts?</i></b>

15:44.540 --> 15:45.680
<b><i>I've got it!</i></b>

15:45.680 --> 15:46.920
<b><i>Get ready to die!</i></b>

15:46.920 --> 15:47.880
<b>What?</b>

15:51.150 --> 15:53.510
<b>He was trying to attack you. You know him?</b>

15:53.510 --> 15:55.640
<b>Nope, no idea.</b>

15:56.490 --> 15:59.880
<b>As if monsters weren't enough.
 Now we're fighting hoodlums too?</b>

15:59.880 --> 16:00.770
<b>Where's it end?</b>

16:01.250 --> 16:04.780
<b>By the way, have you heard what's going on?</b>

16:04.780 --> 16:05.900
<b>I haven't.</b>

16:06.370 --> 16:10.200
<b>I don't know the details myself,
 but monsters are rampaging all over,</b>

16:10.200 --> 16:13.360
<b>and there's a guy hunting heroes
 and calling himself a monster.</b>

16:13.730 --> 16:15.550
<b>It's been pretty busy.</b>

16:15.550 --> 16:16.700
<b>That so?</b>

16:17.330 --> 16:20.170
<b>The hero hunter dude has me a bit curious.</b>

16:20.170 --> 16:20.910
<b>Yeah?</b>

16:21.700 --> 16:25.630
<b>There's never been a human 
who calls himself a monster before.</b>

16:26.310 --> 16:30.460
<b>It reminds me of when I was calling
 myself a "hero" and doing my own thing.</b>

16:31.150 --> 16:33.360
<b>So I'm hoping he lives up to his claim.</b>

16:33.360 --> 16:36.460
<b>He might even be stronger than me, you know?</b>

16:36.460 --> 16:37.820
<b>I see.</b>

16:37.820 --> 16:40.020
<b>Hope you run into him soon.</b>

16:50.730 --> 16:52.110
<b>Show yourself.</b>

16:54.050 --> 16:54.570
<b>Who areâ€”</b>

16:56.100 --> 16:57.410
<b><i>There's two of them!</i></b>

16:58.390 --> 16:59.910
<b>You attacked me,</b>

16:59.910 --> 17:02.830
<b>so I assume you're ready to die!</b>

17:08.710 --> 17:09.750
<b>"Attacked"?</b>

17:10.130 --> 17:12.340
<b>Sounds unfriendly.</b>

17:12.340 --> 17:13.590
<b>I'm sure you agree,</b>

17:13.590 --> 17:18.720
<b>Speed-o'-Sound Sonic,
 last surviving member of the Final 44?</b>

17:19.530 --> 17:20.970
<b>You're from the village?</b>

17:21.520 --> 17:23.600
<b>We are of the Golden 37.</b>

17:23.600 --> 17:24.850
<b>I am Tempest Wind.</b>

17:25.180 --> 17:27.190
<b>Hellfire Flame.</b>

17:27.190 --> 17:29.550
<b>What do you want with me?</b>

17:29.550 --> 17:30.730
<b>To recruit you.</b>

17:31.140 --> 17:33.240
<b>Interested in doing something big?</b>

17:33.240 --> 17:35.050
<b>Something big?</b>

17:35.050 --> 17:35.570
<b>Indeed.</b>

17:35.990 --> 17:38.790
<b>We're planning on taking over this little planet</b>

17:38.790 --> 17:41.700
<b>as monsters who transcend humankind.</b>

17:41.700 --> 17:46.580
<b>There's an organization comprised only 
of monsters called the Monster Association.</b>

17:46.580 --> 17:48.330
<b>We're members.</b>

17:48.330 --> 17:51.170
<b>And we're about to flip this world on its head.</b>

17:51.170 --> 17:53.750
<b>Sounds like a bunch of horseshit.</b>

17:54.340 --> 17:56.090
<b>Besides, where do I fit in?</b>

17:56.530 --> 17:59.980
<b>We want to be certain 
we can take down Flashy Flash.</b>

17:59.980 --> 18:00.930
<b>Help us.</b>

18:00.930 --> 18:02.600
<b>Ridiculous.</b>

18:02.600 --> 18:05.270
<b>I have no obligation to you,
 nor the time to play games.</b>

18:05.270 --> 18:08.230
<b>Get lost, unless you'd prefer to die.</b>

18:08.230 --> 18:10.400
<b>Let's give him a taste.</b>

18:11.530 --> 18:13.730
<b>Remember how we said "Monster Association"?</b>

18:14.130 --> 18:14.990
<b>We, too...</b>

18:15.390 --> 18:16.740
<b>...are monsters!</b>

18:18.450 --> 18:20.450
<b>You'll be a monster, that's all.</b>

18:20.450 --> 18:23.950
<b>It's far better than any
 enhancement drug or implant.</b>

18:26.130 --> 18:29.170
<b>The thought of getting stronger tempts you?</b>

18:29.560 --> 18:31.280
<b>This is a monster cell.</b>

18:31.280 --> 18:34.130
<b>All you have to do is ingest it.</b>

18:34.420 --> 18:36.880
<b>Here, you can have this one.</b>

18:37.290 --> 18:40.230
<b>See you at the Monster Association.</b>

18:44.470 --> 18:49.350
<b><i>No matter how much I train,
 I see no path to beating him.</i></b>

18:49.350 --> 18:51.970
<b><i>But I'd pay any price for victory over Saitama.</i></b>

18:51.970 --> 18:53.650
<b><i>Now that price...</i></b>

18:54.100 --> 18:56.460
<b><i>...is giving up my humanity.</i></b>

18:56.460 --> 19:00.860
<b><i>Ever since I lost to him,
 I've felt as if I was already dead.</i></b>

19:01.160 --> 19:03.730
<b><i>And I have no attachments to my human life.</i></b>

19:04.350 --> 19:05.330
<b><i>Saitama...</i></b>

19:05.330 --> 19:07.750
<b><i>I've decided to be a monster.</i></b>

19:09.680 --> 19:12.110
<b>Monsters remain in some areas.</b>

19:12.110 --> 19:14.890
<b>We can't lift the evacuation order just yet.</b>

19:14.890 --> 19:16.420
<b>It's been a hell of a day...</b>

19:17.050 --> 19:19.930
<b>The most formidable is Martial Gorilla.</b>

19:19.930 --> 19:22.420
<b>He seems obsessed with his own threat level</b>

19:22.420 --> 19:25.310
<b>and declares he'll keep fighting
 until he's at "Demon".</b>

19:25.310 --> 19:27.180
<b>City W, huh?</b>

19:27.670 --> 19:30.170
<b>Have the heroes nearby surround the city.</b>

19:30.170 --> 19:31.100
<b>Not necessary.</b>

19:31.630 --> 19:35.420
<b>Sending in a bunch of fresh meat
 will only waste resources.</b>

19:35.420 --> 19:36.830
<b>Zombieman?!</b>

19:35.570 --> 19:40.320
Class S, Rank 8

19:35.570 --> 19:40.320
Class S, Rank 8

19:36.830 --> 19:38.540
<b>Let me take care of it.</b>

19:38.540 --> 19:40.320
<b>R-Roger!</b>

19:40.320 --> 19:41.860
<b>Time to get to work.</b>

19:41.860 --> 19:45.580
<b>Hey! I'm not seeing any heroes!</b>

19:43.830 --> 19:45.580
<b><i>If I read this right...</i></b>

19:45.580 --> 19:49.830
<b><i>These attacks were masterminded
 by something organized...</i></b>

19:50.300 --> 19:52.110
<b><i>He's not paying attention.</i></b>

19:52.110 --> 19:54.250
<b><i>Perhaps I could track him back to his lair...</i></b>

19:54.790 --> 19:55.590
<b>Hmm?</b>

19:55.590 --> 19:58.420
<b>There's a sturdy fellow...</b>

19:58.420 --> 19:59.690
<b><i>Drat...</i></b>

19:59.690 --> 20:01.050
<b><i>He's attacking a civilian.</i></b>

20:01.380 --> 20:03.430
<b>You a pro hero, big guy?</b>

20:03.770 --> 20:04.370
<b>Sorry?</b>

20:04.370 --> 20:05.640
<b>You're a gorilla!</b>

20:05.990 --> 20:07.470
<b>You're a gorilla, too.</b>

20:08.720 --> 20:11.630
<b>Wh-What are you? Some freelance monster?</b>

20:11.630 --> 20:13.630
<b>What's a freelance monster?</b>

20:13.630 --> 20:16.230
<b>I'm just out buying groceries.</b>

20:16.230 --> 20:17.570
<b>You're shopping?!</b>

20:17.570 --> 20:20.250
<b>Like a monster pretending to live a human life?!</b>

20:20.250 --> 20:22.150
<b>You're a disgrace to gorilla monsters!</b>

20:22.150 --> 20:24.870
<b>I'm not sure how to respond to that...</b>

20:24.870 --> 20:28.120
<b>If you're a potential enemy,
 you die where you stand partially upright!</b>

20:31.610 --> 20:33.770
<b>Take your issues elsewhere.</b>

20:35.890 --> 20:39.300
<b><i>Changing target. I'm following him instead...</i></b>

20:40.450 --> 20:41.730
<b>In the end,</b>

20:41.730 --> 20:46.130
<b>we spent the whole day getting rid of monsters.</b>

20:46.130 --> 20:48.930
<b>Though of course, that's your day job.</b>

20:49.910 --> 20:51.550
<b>Say, Bang...</b>

20:51.550 --> 20:57.440
<b>Think maybe one of the heroes or
 monsters got to Garou in all the chaos?</b>

20:57.440 --> 20:59.900
<b>I don't think so, Brother.</b>

20:59.900 --> 21:03.030
<b>I didn't train him to be weak.</b>

21:04.340 --> 21:08.950
<b>That's why it's my responsibility to defeat him.</b>

21:09.820 --> 21:10.960
<b><i>Garou...</i></b>

21:10.960 --> 21:14.920
<b><i>Do you realize what it means to become a monster?</i></b>

21:15.530 --> 21:17.290
<b><i>If you're going down into darkness,</i></b>

21:17.630 --> 21:20.170
<b><i>at least let it be at my hands.</i></b>

21:22.260 --> 21:25.920
<b>The sun will be setting soon...</b>

21:26.850 --> 21:29.660
<b>We've received a vital report from Drive Knight</b>

21:29.660 --> 21:31.640
<b>regarding the enemy in today's events.</b>

21:32.000 --> 21:33.600
<b>They call themselves the "Monster Association".</b>

21:34.140 --> 21:38.410
<b>While their objectives are unclear,
 they tout themselves as our rivals</b>

21:38.410 --> 21:41.690
<b>and have a method for turning
 humans into monsters.</b>

21:42.240 --> 21:44.570
<b>Their leader is the "Monster King" Orochi.</b>

21:45.180 --> 21:47.500
<b>We also received the
 approximate location of their lair.</b>

21:47.500 --> 21:50.810
<b>It's in the abandoned district of City Z.</b>

21:50.810 --> 21:52.910
<b>The area that was taken by the monsters...</b>

21:52.910 --> 21:57.240
<b>They went through a lot of trouble
 to kidnap an executive's son...</b>

21:57.240 --> 21:59.520
<b>Perhaps it's a sign they want to negotiate.</b>

21:59.520 --> 22:00.400
<b>I agree.</b>

22:00.400 --> 22:02.840
<b>It's their way of saying "don't try anything".</b>

22:02.840 --> 22:08.290
<b>They're probably thinking they can 
talk their way out of extermination.</b>

22:08.290 --> 22:13.140
<b>If the ghost town monsters have formed 
some sort of coalition, that makes sense...</b>

22:13.140 --> 22:15.730
<b>In that case, this riot by the monsters</b>

22:15.730 --> 22:19.100
<b>could have been their way of staging a protest.</b>

22:19.510 --> 22:25.130
<b>These monsters possess 
the intellect to act as a group.</b>

22:25.130 --> 22:28.820
<b>It's extremely likely that they will reach out to us.</b>

22:29.340 --> 22:31.740
<b>That could be our "in".</b>

22:31.740 --> 22:34.950
<b>Let's think of some sort of ruse, then wipe them out.</b>

22:34.950 --> 22:37.630
<b>We should hear what they have to say first.</b>

22:37.630 --> 22:40.830
<b>Our primary objective remains
 the rescue of the hostage.</b>

22:41.200 --> 22:41.840
<b>Correct.</b>

22:41.840 --> 22:45.210
<b>Esteemed advisor Richman is one our top donors.</b>

22:45.210 --> 22:49.060
<b>If anything happens to his son, he could cut us off.</b>

22:49.060 --> 22:50.680
<b>We must rescue the boy.</b>

22:51.180 --> 22:54.390
<b>We received a message

22:54.390 --> 22:57.810
<b>We received a message

<b>We received a message...
