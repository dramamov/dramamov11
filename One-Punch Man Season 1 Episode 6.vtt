<b><i>It's been five days since I debuted as a professional hero.</i></b>

00:06.290 --> 00:08.480
<b><i>There haven't been any serious incidents so far.</i></b>

00:09.390 --> 00:13.840
<b><i>However, for some reason Genos is staying at my house.</i></b>

00:14.790 --> 00:16.770
<b>What are you writing over there?</b>

00:16.770 --> 00:20.200
<b>I'm recording the details of your lessons and training regimen.</b>

00:20.530 --> 00:23.160
<b><i>Crap. He's raising the bar again...</i></b>

00:23.160 --> 00:26.630
<b><i>I can't think of a single thing I can teach the guy.</i></b>

00:26.630 --> 00:29.560
<b><i>I feel bad, like I'm scamming him or something.</i></b>

00:29.560 --> 00:34.140
<b><i>Come on, think. Or just make up some techniques or a spiritual theory.</i></b>

00:34.140 --> 00:36.080
<b><i>Ugh, strength training is all I've got!</i></b>

00:36.080 --> 00:38.720
<b><i>I know Genos won't be satisfied with that, plus the dude's a cyborg!</i></b>

00:38.720 --> 00:39.260
<b>By the way.</b>

00:39.980 --> 00:42.600
<b>At the seminar they said if you're a Class C hero</b>

00:42.870 --> 00:45.130
<b>and you have no hero activity for a week,</b>

00:45.130 --> 00:47.880
<b>your name will be removed from the Hero Registry.</b>

00:47.880 --> 00:49.230
<b>Will you be all right, Sensei?</b>

00:50.110 --> 00:51.720
<b>They said that?!</b>

00:51.720 --> 00:52.320
<b>Yes.</b>

00:52.320 --> 00:55.480
<b>But I was watching TV and there wasn't anything going on.</b>

00:55.480 --> 00:58.930
<b>The news only reports major incidents,</b>

00:58.930 --> 01:02.290
<b>like natural disasters, terrorism and dangerous monsters.</b>

01:02.620 --> 01:05.160
<b>You always fight the most powerful enemies,</b>

01:05.160 --> 01:06.540
<b>so you probably do not know it,</b>

01:06.860 --> 01:09.790
<b>but Class C heroes primarily take care of purse snatchers,</b>

01:09.790 --> 01:12.090
<b>robberies and random attacks.</b>

01:12.090 --> 01:13.640
<b>With Class C so full of heroes,</b>

01:13.640 --> 01:16.440
<b>in order to survive they must 
actively look for cases to resolve.</b>

01:16.440 --> 01:19.050
<b>I hear many of them get discouraged and change careers.</b>

01:19.050 --> 01:21.120
<b>Like a salesman doing cold calls,</b>

01:21.120 --> 01:24.310
<b>nothing will come your way without legwork.</b>

01:24.310 --> 01:26.560
<b>This is no time to be reading manga!</b>

01:26.990 --> 01:27.970
<b>So we're going?</b>

01:27.970 --> 01:28.970
<b>You stay here!</b>

01:28.970 --> 01:30.310
<b>If I'm with a Class S hero,</b>

01:30.310 --> 01:32.900
<b>a Class C like me won't get any credit!</b>

01:32.900 --> 01:35.030
<b>But as your student—</b>

01:36.150 --> 01:39.960
<b>Genos, from the beginning my intense desire to be a hero</b>

01:39.960 --> 01:42.490
<b>was what drove me to strength training.</b>

01:42.490 --> 01:44.760
<b>That's how I made it this far.</b>

01:44.760 --> 01:50.460
<b>For you, perhaps things will change if you aim higher as a hero.</b>

01:51.330 --> 01:55.260
<b>Frankly speaking, you're a cyborg, so training your body won't do.</b>

01:55.260 --> 01:58.600
<b>Instead, a change in mindset may lead you to greater strength.</b>

02:00.270 --> 02:03.760
<b><i>Damn, I'm just making all this crap up...</i></b>

02:04.850 --> 02:06.980
<b>So... in other words,</b>

02:06.980 --> 02:10.260

<b>Yeah, let's get on with it.</b>

12:20.590 --> 12:25.090
<b>Z-City is quite expansive, but further ahead lies</b>

12:25.090 --> 12:27.550
<b>the uninhabited area we were told about.</b>

12:27.550 --> 12:29.270

12:28.600 --> 12:32.850
<b>{=95}BEWARE OF
 MONSTERS!!</b>

12:29.270 --> 12:32.850
<b>Z-City has an abnormally high rate of monster-related incidents.</b>

12:33.730 --> 12:36.730
<b>The frequency has been gradually increasing over the past 10 years,</b>

12:37.400 --> 12:40.610
<b>while the last few have seen more and more highly advanced monsters appearing.</b>

12:41.240 --> 12:44.570
<b>The residents have entirely fled for the city center.</b>

12:44.570 --> 12:45.990
<b>I know all that.</b>

12:45.990 --> 12:47.700
<b>The place is a real ghost town,</b>

12:47.700 --> 12:50.910
<b>just with the water and electricity still intact, yeah?</b>

12:50.910 --> 12:53.210
<b>On the lookout for a cheap house?</b>

12:53.210 --> 12:54.120
<b>Come off it.</b>

12:54.830 --> 12:57.750
<b>People say something real nasty's living 'round here.</b>

12:57.750 --> 12:59.800
<b>Even you must've heard.</b>

12:59.800 --> 13:01.260
<b>But of course.</b>

13:01.260 --> 13:05.630
<b>I assume that's why <i>we</i> have 
been assigned this investigation.</b>

13:06.050 --> 13:10.510
<b>Once we hit the abandoned area, 
we better be ready to fight.</b>

13:10.510 --> 13:14.180
<b>Indeed, we mustn't let our guard down.</b>

13:15.850 --> 13:19.400
<b>But, why here? 
Why the increase in monsters here?</b>

13:19.400 --> 13:21.480
<b>That's the mystery.</b>

13:21.480 --> 13:25.360
<b>Many theories have been advanced, but my own is this:</b>

13:25.360 --> 13:28.990
<b>A colony of monsters here is naturally producing more of them.</b>

13:28.990 --> 13:32.160
<b>Or perhaps a Queen exists, birthing more of her kind.</b>

13:35.210 --> 13:38.750
<b>Of course I have no proof yet,</b>

13:38.750 --> 13:41.550
<b>but there is something to this ghost town...</b>

13:42.000 --> 13:44.010
<b>Or rather, something <i>in</i> it.</b>

13:44.510 --> 13:46.880
<b>Of that you can be sure.</b>

13:48.220 --> 13:50.510
<b>The proximity alarm?</b>

13:50.510 --> 13:52.600
<b>If we can hunt down this mysterious being,</b>

13:52.600 --> 13:55.180
<b>we'll go straight to the top of the rankings.</b>

13:55.180 --> 13:56.480
<b>That's true.</b>

13:56.480 --> 13:59.270
<b>We can't let Amai Mask-san remain first for—</b>

13:59.690 --> 14:00.730
<b><i>Something's there?!</i></b>

13:59.690 --> 14:00.730
<b><i>Something's there?!</i></b>

14:00.730 --> 14:02.270
<b>Was that a monster?</b>

14:02.270 --> 14:04.070
<b>No way to be sure...</b>

14:04.070 --> 14:07.990
<b>But it's hard to imagine a human still living in these conditions.</b>

14:08.570 --> 14:09.450
<b>Let's pursue it!</b>

14:13.370 --> 14:15.580
<b>Seems they are not after us.</b>

14:17.920 --> 14:20.380
<b>Is this be the place I heard about?</b>

14:20.670 --> 14:23.420
<b>Sure don't seem like it...</b>

14:23.420 --> 14:27.880
<b>Aw man, I came all this way. Isn't anyone around?</b>

14:30.840 --> 14:33.470
<b>A monster. It popped up out of nowhere.</b>

14:33.970 --> 14:36.480
<b>Golden Ball-san, are you ready?</b>

14:36.480 --> 14:37.640
<b>Hell yeah!</b>

14:37.640 --> 14:39.400
<b>Victory to the swift!</b>

14:39.400 --> 14:40.900
<b>Hey, people!</b>

14:41.190 --> 14:43.690
<b>I can blast through a 20mm steel plate</b>

14:43.690 --> 14:45.940
<b>with one of my shape-memory golden bullets!</b>

14:46.280 --> 14:47.530
<b>Eat this!</b>

14:56.250 --> 14:57.830
<b>He flicked it away like nothing.</b>

15:10.510 --> 15:11.640

<b>Tomboy...</b>

<b>...Thrust!</b>

16:01.520 --> 16:04.060
<b><i>It slipped past my Tomboy?</i></b>

16:10.650 --> 16:12.200
<b>Not bad.</b>

16:12.740 --> 16:14.160
<b><i>Those tentacles...</i></b>

16:14.160 --> 16:16.450
<b><i>From the way they react, they're tough as steel.</i></b>

16:16.830 --> 16:19.750
<b><i>A monster that can use its infinite number of tentacles</i></b>

16:19.750 --> 16:21.710
<b><i>like steel whips...</i></b>

16:22.290 --> 16:23.540
<b><i>Such power!</i></b>

16:27.790 --> 16:30.510
<b><i>I must call in reinforcements from the Association.</i></b>

16:31.340 --> 16:36.300
<b>May I ask if you were born in this neighborhood?</b>

16:37.470 --> 16:39.680
<b>Nah, I'm from out of town.</b>

16:40.020 --> 16:44.560
<b>I heard a bunch of crazy strong monsters were all getting together here.</b>

16:44.560 --> 16:48.860
<b>Looks like it was just a rumor though.</b>

16:48.860 --> 16:50.320
<b>But now,</b>

16:52.110 --> 16:57.530
<b>I feel like it'd be kinda fun to stick around and make the rumor true.</b>

16:57.530 --> 16:59.580
<b>"The Ghost Town Monster..."</b>

16:59.990 --> 17:02.660
<b>It's got a nice ring to it!</b>

17:03.540 --> 17:07.500
<b>We have a backup request from the heroes dispatched to Z-City.</b>

17:07.500 --> 17:10.880
<b>Class A rank 29, Golden Ball, has been knocked out.</b>

17:10.880 --> 17:13.920
<b>Class A rank 33, Spring Mustachio, is in trouble.</b>

17:13.920 --> 17:15.470
<b>They're in the abandoned city.</b>

17:15.470 --> 17:18.430
<b>Call in all nearby heroes for immediate assistance!</b>

17:18.430 --> 17:19.560
<b>Class A and above!</b>

17:20.260 --> 17:22.560
<b>See the monster alert for Z-City?</b>

17:22.560 --> 17:25.270
<b>The threat level seems to be Tiger or higher.</b>

17:25.270 --> 17:27.400
<b>Is it the ghost town monster?</b>

17:27.400 --> 17:29.650
<b>They're not sure yet.</b>

17:29.650 --> 17:30.730
<b>I'll go...</b>

17:32.110 --> 17:34.490
<b>I want to catch the tiger by its tail.</b>

17:47.000 --> 17:48.130
<b>Now I see...</b>

17:48.580 --> 17:51.630
<b>If it means running into monsters like this all the time</b>

17:52.000 --> 17:55.760
<b>I wouldn't want to live here either.</b>

17:58.970 --> 18:02.060
<b>Man, boring. This is boring me!</b>

18:02.060 --> 18:05.890
<b>I finally kick a hero's butt and I 
don't get even a single scream.</b>

18:06.390 --> 18:10.060
<b>Now that I think about it, even if I start living here,</b>

18:10.060 --> 18:12.610
<b>I'll never be famous if there's no people.</b>

18:13.320 --> 18:17.820
<b>Guess I'll keep going. Gotta find where they live.</b>

18:19.240 --> 18:20.820
<b>There's somebody.</b>

18:20.820 --> 18:22.870
<b>Another hero?</b>

18:23.830 --> 18:25.080
<b>Or a regular guy?</b>

18:25.660 --> 18:28.670
<b>I thought all the humans cleared out.</b>

18:28.670 --> 18:30.460
<b>If all those monsters were really around,</b>

18:30.460 --> 18:32.750
<b>there's no way he could live here...</b>

18:34.590 --> 18:38.470
<b>I guess that means it was just a rumor.</b>

18:38.470 --> 18:39.300
<b>Shoot...</b>

18:40.890 --> 18:43.180
<b>I forgot to buy konbu soup stock.</b>

18:47.310 --> 18:51.020
<b>Sensei, I saw a lot of konbu right outside the door.</b>

18:51.020 --> 18:53.690
<b>Oh yeah, I just...</b>

18:54.650 --> 18:58.740
<b>just happened... to get it for cheap.</b>

19:02.070 --> 19:05.120
<b>Yes, people say that konbu is good for hair growth,</b>

19:05.120 --> 19:06.950
<b>but since there is no real scientific proof,</b>

19:06.950 --> 19:09.120
<b>its real effects are yet to be confirmed.</b>

19:09.620 --> 19:12.460
<b>I did some research, so I am sure, Sensei.</b>

19:13.130 --> 19:15.000
<b>For example, according to this site—</b>

19:15.000 --> 19:16.630
<b>No one said anything about hair!</b>

19:17.340 --> 19:19.130
<b>Z-City Investigative Report.</b>

19:19.130 --> 19:23.140
<b>"Nothing noteworthy about the downtown or residential areas.</b>

19:23.600 --> 19:24.720
<b>During our investigation,</b>

19:24.720 --> 19:27.600
<b>we encountered a ferocious monster in the abandoned area,</b>

19:27.600 --> 19:29.640
<b>but were unable to exterminate it.</b>

19:30.230 --> 19:31.850
<b>We escaped death,</b>

19:31.850 --> 19:33.980
<b>but the monster we encountered disappeared</b>

19:33.980 --> 19:36.860
<b>and it is possible that it still roams the area.</b>

19:36.860 --> 19:39.780
<b>Also, according to this monster, there's a rumor that...</b>

19:39.780 --> 19:43.910
<b>...powerful monsters already exist in this area."</b>

19:44.620 --> 19:47.910
<b>Sounds like it was pretty brutal.</b>

19:48.250 --> 19:49.540
<b>A monster?</b>

19:49.540 --> 19:50.910
<b>Y-Yes.</b>

19:53.540 --> 19:55.420
<b>I think I'll pass this time.</b>

19:55.710 --> 19:58.760
<b>See? I told you I should have gone!</b>

<b>faced with this,</b>

20:02.220 --> 20:06.390
<b>I'm sure even you would have had a tough time.</b>

20:09.930 --> 20:13.810
<b>I would have been fine, idiot!</b>

20:14.900 --> 20:19.480
<b>The rumor has not been confirmed, but the reinforcements saw signs</b>

20:19.480 --> 20:22.150
<b>that point to the existence of some horrible monstrosity.</b>

20:22.150 --> 20:24.660
<b>Holy crap, what is this?</b>

20:24.660 --> 20:27.410
<b>What kind of monster could cause such violence?</b>

20:27.410 --> 20:30.200
<b>I'd hate to face off against this thing.</b>

20:30.540 --> 20:32.710
<b>Hey, what's this?</b>

20:33.500 --> 20:36.960
<b>Is it a part of the monster Spring Mustachio fought?</b>

20:36.960 --> 20:38.960
<b>There may have been a territorial dispute</b>

20:38.960 --> 20:40.170
<b>between the monsters...</b>

20:40.800 --> 20:44.340
<b>Seems like there's definitely "something" here.</b>

20:45.340 --> 20:49.770
<b>We must continue our investigation and maintain vigilance over Z-City.</b>

20:51.930 --> 20:53.390
<b>Hey, did you hear?</b>

20:53.390 --> 20:55.940
<b>There are monsters living in the Z-City ghost town.</b>

20:56.440 --> 21:00.940
<b>Yeah, rumor has it the toughest ones are secretly plotting something.</b>

21:00.940 --> 21:05.530
<b>No, no. Not that rumor. 
It's about a more dangerous monster.</b>

21:05.530 --> 21:06.740
<b>What's that?</b>

21:06.740 --> 21:07.950
<b>You didn't hear?</b>
