00:13:38.870 --> 00:13:39.580
there is only one way:

00:13:40.480 --> 00:13:41.340
lure them in with bait.

00:13:42.120 --> 00:13:42.820
I will be the bait!

00:14:16.790 --> 00:14:17.610
To break the formation,

00:14:18.240 --> 00:14:18.940
one must be sacrificed

00:14:18.960 --> 00:14:20.100
to find the point of escape.

00:14:21.270 --> 00:14:22.130
What's the point of us

00:14:22.320 --> 00:14:22.940
striking together?

00:14:23.630 --> 00:14:24.250
I know.

00:14:25.960 --> 00:14:26.420
Let me do it!

00:14:29.120 --> 00:14:29.820
Madman.

00:14:30.960 --> 00:14:31.650
Then I'm leaving!

00:14:32.680 --> 00:14:39.280
♪I look back to see peaks in clouds. I close my eyes and the scene comes alive♪

00:14:39.670 --> 00:14:40.490
The weak point!

00:14:43.840 --> 00:14:46.840
♪I burst into the world, and the realm is forever changed♪

00:14:46.960 --> 00:14:49.160

00:14:54.280 --> 00:14:57.640
♪In this borrowed life, I neither love nor hate♪

00:14:57.800 --> 00:15:01.560
♪I cross the wide river with a leap of faith♪

00:15:01.680 --> 00:15:05.160
♪My eyes filled with tears♪

00:15:05.360 --> 00:15:08.560
♪Against the current, I glimpse my reflection♪

00:15:08.640 --> 00:15:14.800
♪Forget who I am, for I am part of us all♪

00:16:46.080 --> 00:16:47.130
Only the two of us remain.

00:16:51.790 --> 00:16:52.700
So...

00:16:59.150 --> 00:16:59.980
Are you insane?

00:17:03.270 --> 00:17:04.140
You lunatic,

00:17:04.750 --> 00:17:05.380
stop it!

00:17:06.400 --> 00:17:07.290
I told you

00:17:08.590 --> 00:17:09.420
I would repay

00:17:10.440 --> 00:17:11.860
the debt I owe you someday.

00:17:14.070 --> 00:17:15.180
I don't need your repayment.

00:17:16.480 --> 00:17:17.180
When you took my place

00:17:17.200 --> 00:17:18.330
as a Lamp Child,

00:17:18.350 --> 00:17:19.380
you already repaid me.

00:17:23.030 --> 00:17:24.290
Blood River has its rules.

00:17:24.830 --> 00:17:25.900
In each group of ten, only one

00:17:25.920 --> 00:17:26.940
walks out of the Wailing Abyss

00:17:27.270 --> 00:17:28.490
and joins one of the Three Families.

00:17:29.200 --> 00:17:30.330
If you don't take this favor,

00:17:31.790 --> 00:17:33.460
we will both die!

00:17:33.920 --> 00:17:35.010
There must be another way.

00:17:36.070 --> 00:17:37.090
I'll talk to them.

00:17:38.270 --> 00:17:39.810
They want the finest assassins,

00:17:41.030 --> 00:17:41.900
and the two of us

00:17:42.510 --> 00:17:43.730
are the best

00:17:43.830 --> 00:17:45.010
they've found in years.

00:17:45.830 --> 00:17:46.420
They would never

00:17:46.480 --> 00:17:47.700
want to lose us both.

00:17:52.160 --> 00:17:52.660
You...

00:17:53.680 --> 00:17:54.700
you're too naive.

00:18:05.160 --> 00:18:06.810
Let go!

00:18:16.720 --> 00:18:18.460
Let go!

00:18:20.270 --> 00:18:21.420
Those who are strong enough

00:18:22.920 --> 00:18:24.140
have the right to be naive.

00:19:16.310 --> 00:19:16.900
You're awake?

00:19:23.480 --> 00:19:25.420
I had a long, long dream

00:19:25.920 --> 00:19:28.620
about things from long ago.

00:19:59.790 --> 00:20:01.140
Fiends and heretics,

00:20:02.310 --> 00:20:03.900
keep away from me.

00:20:04.110 --> 00:20:06.220
- If we are the fiends and heretics... - If we are the fiends and heretics...

00:20:06.400 --> 00:20:07.770
- Is Blood River... - Is Blood River...

00:20:07.790 --> 00:20:09.660
- Righteous? - Righteous?

00:20:10.790 --> 00:20:12.570
You are but demonic illusions.

00:20:13.440 --> 00:20:15.570
I will slay you at one stroke!

00:20:21.880 --> 00:20:35.050
- Give us back our lives! - Give us back our lives!

00:20:37.830 --> 00:20:38.290
Oh, no.

00:20:45.030 --> 00:20:45.660
Sir...

00:20:53.310 --> 00:20:54.380
When a person is weak,

00:20:54.590 --> 00:20:56.050
evil finds a way

00:20:56.160 --> 00:20:57.010
to seep in.

00:20:57.110 --> 00:20:58.420
Nightmares are normal.

00:20:59.070 --> 00:20:59.570
Sir,

00:20:59.750 --> 00:21:00.490
you need not worry.

00:21:04.720 --> 00:21:05.860
Sir, are you well?

00:21:15.510 --> 00:21:16.220
Rabbit.

00:21:20.790 --> 00:21:21.180
Yes.

00:21:25.200 --> 00:21:26.220
Miss Bai,

00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:30.050
how many lives

00:21:32.510 --> 00:21:33.460
have you saved in your life?

00:21:37.110 --> 00:21:38.220
Well...

00:21:40.070 --> 00:21:41.490
I never kept count.

00:21:47.480 --> 00:21:49.250
Including Second Master Tang,

00:21:50.200 --> 00:21:51.090
I

00:21:51.440 --> 00:21:52.180
have slain

00:21:53.110 --> 00:21:55.050
832 people.

00:21:56.240 --> 00:21:57.460
I've forgotten

00:21:58.550 --> 00:22:00.460
many of their faces,

00:22:01.400 --> 00:22:02.420
but a voice

00:22:02.550 --> 00:22:04.180
always tells me

00:22:05.720 --> 00:22:07.330
those are the ones I killed.

00:22:11.350 --> 00:22:12.980
I was never afraid of such dreams.

00:22:15.790 --> 00:22:17.490
When those people appeared,

00:22:18.480 --> 00:22:20.420
I'd take my sword

00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:23.380
and cut them all to pieces.

00:22:24.350 --> 00:22:27.700
I killed them once,

00:22:30.110 --> 00:22:31.010
so of course

00:22:31.200 --> 00:22:33.460
I could kill them twice

00:22:34.070 --> 00:22:35.050
and thrice,

00:22:36.030 --> 00:22:38.860
whether in dreams

00:22:39.960 --> 00:22:41.770
or in reality.

00:22:46.030 --> 00:22:47.090
But just now,

00:22:47.920 --> 00:22:49.220
when I drew my sword,

00:22:50.550 --> 00:22:51.770
I saw that it had

00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:53.860
already broken.

00:22:57.440 --> 00:22:58.730
I want Muyu

00:23:00.680 --> 00:23:01.620
by my side at once.

00:23:02.720 --> 00:23:05.380
Aren't you worried

00:23:06.160 --> 00:23:07.180
he might

00:23:08.790 --> 00:23:09.530
betray you now?

00:23:11.310 --> 00:23:11.980
He won't.

00:23:34.640 --> 00:23:36.090
After sitting in the carriage for so long,

00:23:37.070 --> 00:23:38.010
I'm truly tired.

00:23:39.960 --> 00:23:40.810
Changhe,

00:23:41.160 --> 00:23:42.700
in this state, can you really catch up to them?

00:23:43.960 --> 00:23:45.250
What's your plan really?

00:23:45.790 --> 00:23:46.940
I will catch up.

00:23:47.590 --> 00:23:49.090
The Patriarch went north

00:23:49.200 --> 00:23:50.700
only to buy time.

00:23:50.790 --> 00:23:51.940
Knowing what he's like,

00:23:53.440 --> 00:23:54.570
I can't be sure if the Old Man

00:23:54.590 --> 00:23:55.250
will be safe,

00:23:55.720 --> 00:23:57.140
but he will surely move

00:23:57.590 --> 00:23:58.620
to wipe out us errand boys.

00:23:59.110 --> 00:24:00.010
So as far as I'm concerned,

00:24:00.960 --> 00:24:02.620
the Patriarch must die.

00:24:04.110 --> 00:24:04.730
And?

00:24:08.270 --> 00:24:09.700
My arrangements for Su Muyu

00:24:09.750 --> 00:24:10.570
should be in place.

00:24:10.960 --> 00:24:12.090
He will run into a few old acquaintances

00:24:12.640 --> 00:24:13.490
so he won't

00:24:13.720 --> 00:24:15.050
catch up to the Patriarch so soon.

00:24:19.620 --> 00:24:20.200
Hyah!

00:24:20.470 --> 00:24:21.020
Hyah!

00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:25.500
Hyah!

[Su Changli of the Su family]

00:24:34.790 --> 00:24:35.420
Changli?

00:24:36.160 --> 00:24:36.530
Yu,

00:24:37.200 --> 00:24:37.900
long time no see.

00:24:38.510 --> 00:24:39.420
Did Changhe send you?

00:24:41.200 --> 00:24:42.460
Yes, he did.

00:24:43.240 --> 00:24:44.530
He told me to stop you,

00:24:44.790 --> 00:24:45.490
and if all else fails,

00:24:46.200 --> 00:24:47.140
to cry until you relent.

00:24:48.590 --> 00:24:49.460
Does he think

00:24:49.960 --> 00:24:50.860
I won't kill you?

00:24:53.440 --> 00:24:54.010
I...

00:24:54.240 --> 00:24:55.980
He thinks he can read my mind,

00:24:57.030 --> 00:24:58.220
but I have killed so many

00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:01.220
that there are times I can't

00:25:01.240 --> 00:25:02.490
hold back the urge to kill.

00:25:09.960 --> 00:25:10.770
If I'd wanted to kill you,

00:25:11.750 --> 00:25:12.530
you'd already be dead.

00:25:12.830 --> 00:25:13.460
Hyah!

00:25:16.030 --> 00:25:16.490
Yu!

[Su Zhi of the Su family]

00:25:55.790 --> 00:25:56.290
Teacher.

00:25:57.400 --> 00:25:59.380
You flatter me. I'm hardly worthy

00:25:59.960 --> 00:26:01.090
of being called "teacher"

00:26:01.830 --> 00:26:02.940
by you.

00:26:03.830 --> 00:26:04.770
Mr. Su Zhi.

00:26:05.880 --> 00:26:07.050
It's been a long time,

00:26:07.880 --> 00:26:08.770
Su Muyu.

00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:10.180
So Changhe even got you involved

00:26:11.350 --> 00:26:12.700
just to stop me.

00:26:13.200 --> 00:26:14.180
Don't blame him.

00:26:14.920 --> 00:26:16.140
I came of my own will.

00:26:16.880 --> 00:26:18.050
After this,

00:26:18.790 --> 00:26:19.730
we might never

00:26:19.790 --> 00:26:20.900
meet again,

00:26:21.830 --> 00:26:23.570
so I volunteered to see you once more

00:26:25.270 --> 00:26:25.980
and play

00:26:26.790 --> 00:26:27.620
a game of weiqi with you.

00:26:30.200 --> 00:26:31.420
I'm heading somewhere. I don't have time.

00:26:32.160 --> 00:26:33.290
If there's another chance to see you,

00:26:33.960 --> 00:26:34.620
I will visit the library

00:26:35.350 --> 00:26:36.620
once I return to Blood River.

00:26:37.750 --> 00:26:38.770
If I fail

00:26:38.960 --> 00:26:40.330
to make you finish this game,

00:26:41.200 --> 00:26:42.380
Changhe may

00:26:44.680 --> 00:26:45.420
kill me.

00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:08.940
Did you come

00:27:09.880 --> 00:27:11.490
to persuade me to join forces with Changhe?

00:27:13.270 --> 00:27:14.860
The two of you are the most remarkable pair

Blood River has seen in the past century.

00:27:16.960 --> 00:27:18.770
You've overcome countless crises together.

I believe

00:27:21.480 --> 00:27:22.050
you can

00:27:22.110 --> 00:27:23.180
do it again this time.

00:27:24.310 --> 00:27:25.250
I heard from Changhe

00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:26.660
that you

00:27:26.680 --> 00:27:27.660
made a pact four years ago

00:27:28.680 --> 00:27:30.180
that he'd become head of the Su family,

00:27:31.070 --> 00:27:32.460
and you'd rise as the Patriarch,

00:27:33.880 --> 00:27:35.860
the new master of Blood River.

00:27:38.640 --> 00:27:39.730
Then did he tell you

00:27:40.960 --> 00:27:42.380
that I never agreed to that pact?

00:27:46.750 --> 00:27:47.900
Does the Patriarch

00:27:48.750 --> 00:27:49.980
truly deserve such loyalty from you?

00:27:52.960 --> 00:27:54.220
Does the answer to that question matter?

00:27:58.350 --> 00:27:58.860
Muyu,

00:27:59.720 --> 00:28:00.940
when you answer

00:28:00.960 --> 00:28:01.380
a question

00:28:01.400 --> 00:28:02.490
with another question,

00:28:03.480 --> 00:28:04.660
it means you haven't

00:28:05.510 --> 00:28:06.330
made up your mind.

00:28:07.310 --> 00:28:08.330
But some questions have no right answer,

00:28:09.480 --> 00:28:10.090
only choices to make.

00:28:10.920 --> 00:28:12.490
I've stayed with the Su family for nearly a decade.

00:28:13.240 --> 00:28:14.050
Changhe and I

00:28:14.590 --> 00:28:16.140
emerged from the same Furnace

00:28:16.200 --> 00:28:17.330
as martial brothers.

00:28:18.480 --> 00:28:19.290
To be precise,

00:28:20.830 --> 00:28:21.810
we are all family.

00:28:26.270 --> 00:28:27.570
A man like Changhe

00:28:28.270 --> 00:28:29.570
would never consider the family head

00:28:29.680 --> 00:28:30.570
his family.

00:28:31.480 --> 00:28:32.290
He only

00:28:34.720 --> 00:28:36.180
sees you as family.

00:28:38.070 --> 00:28:39.220
But now I am the Kui.

00:28:41.830 --> 00:28:42.980
My father once told me

00:28:43.960 --> 00:28:44.900
that a promise is more important

00:28:44.920 --> 00:28:45.730
than a life.

00:28:46.510 --> 00:28:47.530
As you yourself once said,

00:28:47.920 --> 00:28:48.660
if an assassin doesn't

00:28:49.160 --> 00:28:49.980
honor their promises,

00:28:50.070 --> 00:28:51.220
they can kill their patron

00:28:51.270 --> 00:28:53.050
for richer pay.

00:28:53.720 --> 00:28:55.180
In the end, order will collapse.

00:28:56.400 --> 00:28:57.900
Assassins will lose their reason to exist.

00:28:58.160 --> 00:28:59.700
And Blood River will also fall apart.

00:29:03.750 --> 00:29:04.530
You are clever,

00:29:05.750 --> 00:29:07.420
but sometimes too stubborn.

00:29:09.590 --> 00:29:11.010
I'm already a pawn for killing.

00:29:12.310 --> 00:29:14.010
If I don't hold onto certain beliefs,

00:29:14.680 --> 00:29:15.290
living will feel

00:29:16.830 --> 00:29:17.810
no different from dying.

00:29:24.200 --> 00:29:24.700
Sir,

00:29:26.590 --> 00:29:27.140
you have lost.

00:29:29.830 --> 00:29:30.330
Farewell.

00:29:38.200 --> 00:29:38.660
Yu,

00:29:39.440 --> 00:29:40.140
you will never win.

00:29:41.510 --> 00:29:42.810
The heads of the Three Families have coveted

00:29:42.880 --> 00:29:43.900
the Patriarch's seat for years.

00:29:44.400 --> 00:29:44.810
They will not

00:29:44.880 --> 00:29:45.770
let this opportunity pass.

00:29:46.310 --> 00:29:47.220
Even if the Patriarch

00:29:47.240 --> 00:29:48.180
recovers,

00:29:48.270 --> 00:29:48.860
they will

00:29:48.960 --> 00:29:50.180
stop at nothing to kill him.

00:29:50.270 --> 00:29:51.490
You're fighting a losing battle.

00:29:51.920 --> 00:29:52.810
If so,

00:29:54.440 --> 00:29:54.900
what is Changhe

00:29:54.960 --> 00:29:56.050
trying to do?

00:29:56.200 --> 00:29:57.420
He wants to change Blood River.

00:30:00.110 --> 00:30:01.050
Cross the "blood river,"

00:30:02.240 --> 00:30:03.250
and we will reach the other shore.

00:30:05.400 --> 00:30:06.180
On that shore,

00:30:06.440 --> 00:30:07.380
there will be no more darkness.

00:30:08.200 --> 00:30:08.900
Instead,

00:30:10.160 --> 00:30:10.730
light will prevail.

00:30:13.350 --> 00:30:14.250
Join us.

00:30:15.030 --> 00:30:15.940
Changhe plans

00:30:16.240 --> 00:30:17.180
to have the Patriarch die

00:30:17.240 --> 00:30:18.330
at the right time

00:30:18.640 --> 00:30:19.860
and pass the Dormant Dragon Sword to you

00:30:19.960 --> 00:30:20.490
before he dies.

00:30:20.640 --> 00:30:21.490
You will command Blood River,

00:30:21.920 --> 00:30:22.770
while he will

00:30:22.790 --> 00:30:23.460
clear the obstacles

00:30:23.510 --> 00:30:24.490
and become its new head.

00:30:24.960 --> 00:30:26.140
Then, if the other two families

00:30:26.240 --> 00:30:27.090
resist,

00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:29.730
you two will join hands to purge Blood River.

00:30:32.680 --> 00:30:33.090
Yu?

00:30:33.880 --> 00:30:34.250
Sorry.

00:30:35.720 --> 00:30:36.570
I've made my choice.

00:30:42.240 --> 00:30:42.860
Changhe said it.

00:30:43.440 --> 00:30:44.140
If you don't cooperate,

00:30:44.310 --> 00:30:45.010
he will make himself

00:30:45.070 --> 00:30:46.050
the Patriarch.

00:30:46.400 --> 00:30:47.010
When he does,

00:30:47.030 --> 00:30:47.860
he will kill

00:30:47.880 --> 00:30:48.900
whoever stands in his way,

00:30:50.110 --> 00:30:50.770
including you,

00:30:53.640 --> 00:30:55.180
the dearest friend he's ever had.

00:31:05.790 --> 00:31:06.330
Muyu,

00:31:07.920 --> 00:31:09.140
the road will be long and perilous.

00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:11.530
Walk,

00:31:12.070 --> 00:31:12.810
and I shall reach the destination.

00:31:19.750 --> 00:31:22.810
You intend to get poisoned before finding

00:31:23.440 --> 00:31:24.660
the antidote?

00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:26.770
I must say,

00:31:26.960 --> 00:31:29.090
that's really bold.

00:31:30.440 --> 00:31:32.050
There's one thing I don't understand, though.

00:31:32.880 --> 00:31:34.250
Would you really risk your life

00:31:35.240 --> 00:31:38.050
for a few silver notes?

00:31:41.200 --> 00:31:42.420
Of course not.

00:31:42.510 --> 00:31:43.220
I'm not a fool.

00:31:44.790 --> 00:31:46.330
But I know a way

00:31:46.880 --> 00:31:48.570
to feel

00:31:48.830 --> 00:31:50.530
the poison in you just as you do

00:31:50.920 --> 00:31:52.010
while keeping myself alive.

00:31:52.830 --> 00:31:53.770
And what is that?

00:31:56.000 --> 00:31:57.090
The Soul-Swap Technique.

00:32:03.310 --> 00:32:04.810
Medicine King Valley's secret technique,

00:32:04.880 --> 00:32:06.330
the Soul-Swap Technique.

00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:08.810
But

00:32:09.270 --> 00:32:10.810
with this technique,

00:32:11.640 --> 00:32:13.460
the target's five senses,

00:32:14.750 --> 00:32:16.730
their past, and their present thoughts

00:32:17.790 --> 00:32:18.900
are shared

00:32:19.270 --> 00:32:20.620
with the practitioner.

00:32:21.830 --> 00:32:23.460
If the target's will is weak,

00:32:23.750 --> 00:32:25.050
their mind may even

00:32:25.160 --> 00:32:25.980
be seized entirely.

00:32:28.590 --> 00:32:30.460
When I first learned of it,

00:32:30.830 --> 00:32:31.980
I thought:

00:32:32.550 --> 00:32:33.860
this is no medicine;

00:32:34.960 --> 00:32:36.490
it is sorcery.

00:32:40.400 --> 00:32:40.940
True.

00:32:42.640 --> 00:32:43.700
A physician

00:32:44.240 --> 00:32:45.770
treats the body's ailments,

00:32:46.440 --> 00:32:47.380
but the Soul-Swap Technique

00:32:47.510 --> 00:32:48.570
can heal the mind.

00:32:49.510 --> 00:32:50.700
However, my aim with you

00:32:50.750 --> 00:32:51.940
is to purge you completely

00:32:52.350 --> 00:32:53.940
of the toxins

00:32:53.960 --> 00:32:54.940
using this technique.

00:32:55.640 --> 00:32:56.860
As for the thoughts

00:32:56.920 --> 00:32:58.290
you have,

00:32:59.070 --> 00:33:00.180
I will try to ignore them.

00:33:04.750 --> 00:33:05.730
If you

00:33:06.720 --> 00:33:08.860
use this technique,

00:33:09.030 --> 00:33:10.490
then my life...

00:33:13.240 --> 00:33:14.620
Naturally, it will be

00:33:14.680 --> 00:33:16.620
entirely under my control.

00:33:17.510 --> 00:33:18.460
At any moment I wish,

00:33:18.830 --> 00:33:20.620
I could end your life.

00:33:30.510 --> 00:33:31.620
I will try it.

00:33:32.830 --> 00:33:34.330
Let the Patriarch

00:33:34.400 --> 00:33:35.460
live as long as he can.

00:33:35.680 --> 00:33:36.180
Our priority now

00:33:36.440 --> 00:33:37.810
is to hurry and find a chance

00:33:38.070 --> 00:33:38.770
to kill

00:33:38.920 --> 00:33:39.810
that young miracle physician.

00:33:42.270 --> 00:33:44.050
The Patriarch and that physician

00:33:44.440 --> 00:33:46.050
are protected by the Twelve Zodiacs.

00:33:46.550 --> 00:33:47.420
Why do you seem so confident?

00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:52.380
I had a letter sent

00:33:52.920 --> 00:33:54.330
to the imperial city in the north.

00:33:54.960 --> 00:33:56.380
A man there was born of the Tang Clan,

00:33:56.440 --> 00:33:57.140
famed and renowned.

00:33:57.720 --> 00:33:58.570
He's Second Master Tang's

00:33:58.640 --> 00:33:59.730
closest disciple.

00:34:00.440 --> 00:34:01.530
In the Pipa Pavilion of Jiujiang,

00:34:01.720 --> 00:34:03.570
with three hidden weapons, he stunned the world.

00:34:04.440 --> 00:34:06.140
He is a martial arts expert on par

00:34:06.270 --> 00:34:07.380
with Sikong Changfeng

00:34:07.680 --> 00:34:08.690
and Baili Dongjun.

00:34:10.070 --> 00:34:10.980
Tang Lianyue?

00:34:15.220 --> 00:34:16.920
[Tang Lianyue of the Tang Clan]

00:34:16.920 --> 00:34:17.460
I don't know

00:34:17.510 --> 00:34:19.460
why the Patriarch killed Second Master Tang.

00:34:20.190 --> 00:34:20.780
But I know

00:34:20.840 --> 00:34:21.780
Tang Lianyue would be

00:34:22.550 --> 00:34:23.900
the one most driven

00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:26.090
to avenge Second Master Tang.

00:34:55.030 --> 00:34:56.130
Escort the Patriarch away.

00:34:57.230 --> 00:34:57.570
Hurry!

00:34:57.800 --> 00:34:58.300
- Understood. - Understood.

00:35:06.110 --> 00:35:07.210
We barely had time to catch our breath,

00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:09.050
and now we are on the run again.

00:35:10.590 --> 00:35:11.980
Once you heal me,

00:35:12.710 --> 00:35:14.420
no one will dare come after us.

00:35:35.190 --> 00:35:36.010
Found you,

00:35:37.320 --> 00:35:38.170
Blood River.

00:35:51.400 --> 00:35:52.050
Dragon Beard Needles?

00:35:52.630 --> 00:35:53.570
You're from the Tang Clan.

00:35:54.000 --> 00:35:54.530
Tang Lianyue

00:35:55.150 --> 00:35:55.980
of the Tang Clan.

00:35:56.360 --> 00:35:57.420
Tang Lianyue?

00:35:58.400 --> 00:35:59.090
I see.

00:35:59.880 --> 00:36:01.820
You are the Xuanwu Guardian, one of Tianqi City's

00:36:01.920 --> 00:36:02.740
Four Guardians.

00:36:03.550 --> 00:36:04.740
You are not the one I seek.

00:36:05.670 --> 00:36:07.010
Where is your Patriarch?

00:36:07.400 --> 00:36:08.090
I need to see him.

00:36:08.840 --> 00:36:10.340
Even if you are the Xuanwu Guardian,

00:36:12.190 --> 00:36:13.980
for one, we are not in Tianqi City,

00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:15.610
and for another,

00:36:15.880 --> 00:36:16.860
Blood River

00:36:17.400 --> 00:36:18.860
answers to no imperial orders.

00:36:19.400 --> 00:36:21.130
The Patriarch is not someone you can

00:36:21.590 --> 00:36:22.260
demand to meet.

00:36:22.880 --> 00:36:24.340
I didn't come

00:36:24.360 --> 00:36:25.860
as Tianqi City's Xuanwu Guardian.

00:36:26.710 --> 00:36:28.740
I came as a disciple of the Tang Clan.

00:36:29.480 --> 00:36:30.650
Your Patriarch

00:36:31.400 --> 00:36:33.050
killed our second master.

00:36:33.360 --> 00:36:34.090
I have come

00:36:34.670 --> 00:36:36.050
to settle that score.

00:36:37.280 --> 00:36:38.170
How did you

00:36:38.440 --> 00:36:39.780
learn about this?

00:36:40.230 --> 00:36:41.980
What if it's

00:36:42.400 --> 00:36:43.260
all a rumor?

00:36:44.440 --> 00:36:45.610
I suppose your Patriarch

00:36:45.670 --> 00:36:46.490
left long ago,

00:36:46.920 --> 00:36:48.300
leaving you behind to cover the retreat.

00:36:48.960 --> 00:36:49.860
All this talk

00:36:50.590 --> 00:36:52.130
is just to stall for time.

00:36:53.360 --> 00:36:53.940
You're not leaving.

00:37:05.280 --> 00:37:05.650
Rise!

00:37:10.440 --> 00:37:11.740
What a masterful command of hidden weapons.

00:37:12.230 --> 00:37:13.820
Is this the skill of a top-ranked master

00:37:13.880 --> 00:37:15.090
on Baixiao Hall's Roll of Legends?

00:37:18.880 --> 00:37:20.610
Fiery Paper Butterflies and Netherworld Spiders?

00:37:21.070 --> 00:37:22.210
You are the Spider Woman

00:37:22.800 --> 00:37:23.690
of Blood River's Mu family.

00:37:24.190 --> 00:37:25.380
I don't like that code name.

00:37:26.320 --> 00:37:26.980
What a petty trick.

00:37:27.710 --> 00:37:28.980
Did you think I wouldn't notice

00:37:29.030 --> 00:37:29.610
you using

00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:31.690
Fiery Paper Butterflies as cover

00:37:32.070 --> 00:37:33.130
to let Netherworld Spiders

00:37:33.670 --> 00:37:34.980
sneak up and ambush me?

00:37:36.510 --> 00:37:38.260
You think you're clever, but you're a fool.

00:37:42.480 --> 00:37:43.690
What did you put inside the Netherworld Spiders?

00:37:44.280 --> 00:37:45.170
Naturally, Thunder Orbs

00:37:45.280 --> 00:37:46.530
from the Lei family of Thunder Hall.

00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:47.570
How did you

00:37:47.670 --> 00:37:48.860
get those?

00:37:50.070 --> 00:37:50.940
Years ago, when I passed

00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:52.010
by Thunder Hall on a mission,

00:37:52.480 --> 00:37:54.010
quite a few young men

00:37:54.480 --> 00:37:55.420
from the Lei family

00:37:55.480 --> 00:37:56.610
fell head over heels for me.

00:37:57.800 --> 00:37:59.650
Of course, they offered them up with both hands

00:38:00.360 --> 00:38:01.170
to please me.

00:38:03.630 --> 00:38:04.380
Anyway,

00:38:05.480 --> 00:38:06.980
why am I even telling you this?

00:38:46.280 --> 00:38:49.610
♪A son need never learn to read♪

00:38:49.800 --> 00:38:52.900
♪Cockfights and horse races serve him better indeed♪

00:38:53.510 --> 00:38:56.690
♪The Jia boy, only thirteen years old♪

00:38:57.230 --> 00:39:00.340
♪Has more wealth than most nobles♪

00:39:01.030 --> 00:39:03.900
♪He calls the bets and wins with pride♪

♪His father lies dead far away from Chang'an...♪

00:39:11.710 --> 00:39:12.530
When the children light the lamps,

00:39:14.030 --> 00:39:15.170
the ghosts come to claim lives.

00:39:16.550 --> 00:39:17.860
Do you remember

00:39:18.550 --> 00:39:19.900
that back in the day,

00:39:22.550 --> 00:39:25.260
you nearly became one of these Lamp Children as well?

00:39:41.230 --> 00:39:42.490
Mu Yinzhen of the Mu family.

00:39:43.380 --> 00:39:46.340
[Mu Yinzhen of the Mu family]

00:39:46.360 --> 00:39:47.570
You dare fight me?

00:39:48.510 --> 00:39:50.260
Do you mean to betray Blood River?

00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:52.490
Interesting.

00:39:53.440 --> 00:39:54.940
The reports I received

00:39:56.110 --> 00:39:57.980
say you plotted against the Patriarch

00:39:58.590 --> 00:39:59.820
and planned to rebel.

00:40:00.920 --> 00:40:02.010
I came to kill you

00:40:02.920 --> 00:40:04.300
on my family's orders,

00:40:05.320 --> 00:40:07.050
to rescue the Patriarch.

00:40:11.840 --> 00:40:12.460
It seems

00:40:12.510 --> 00:40:14.050
the Mu family is truly loyal.

00:40:29.360 --> 00:40:32.980
I have long heard that Su Muyu, the Umbrella Ghost,

00:40:33.440 --> 00:40:34.740
is famed

00:40:35.760 --> 00:40:37.650
for his Eighteen-Sword Array.

00:40:39.320 --> 00:40:41.740
Yet looking at your stance now,

00:40:43.030 --> 00:40:44.300
you seem to think

00:40:45.190 --> 00:40:46.340
I don't deserve

00:40:47.070 --> 00:40:47.940
to see

00:40:48.000 --> 00:40:49.610
your 18 blades all at once.

00:40:50.960 --> 00:40:52.210
You don't.

00:41:04.480 --> 00:41:06.380
It should've been you back then,

00:41:07.190 --> 00:41:08.650
but Su Changhe took your place

00:41:08.800 --> 00:41:10.420
as a Lamp Child.

00:41:11.840 --> 00:41:13.130
According to my plan,

00:41:13.590 --> 00:41:15.340
they should've all died,

00:41:16.000 --> 00:41:16.900
yet he

00:41:17.550 --> 00:41:19.210
was saved by you.

00:41:28.360 --> 00:41:29.260
I think I see now

00:41:29.320 --> 00:41:31.010
why he stood in for you.

00:41:33.590 --> 00:41:35.940
Had you been one of the Lamp Children,

00:41:38.150 --> 00:41:39.900
you would've surely died.

00:41:40.840 --> 00:41:42.300
I never expected

00:41:42.840 --> 00:41:45.380
the Su family's famed Umbrella Ghost,

00:41:45.880 --> 00:41:47.490
the Nameless who crawled

00:41:47.550 --> 00:41:49.050
from the corpse-strewn Furnace,

00:41:50.920 --> 00:41:53.010
the current Kui, and the leader of the Spider Shadow,

00:41:53.400 --> 00:41:54.570
to be a man

00:41:55.000 --> 00:41:56.530
with a merciful heart

00:41:57.400 --> 00:41:59.300
who cannot strike a child.

00:42:31.880 --> 00:42:32.690
Your sword

00:42:34.440 --> 00:42:36.010
is not as swift as I imagined.

00:42:40.630 --> 00:42:41.170
Is that so?

00:42:50.190 --> 00:42:50.860
Impossible.

00:42:53.400 --> 00:42:55.170
I clearly blocked that strike.

00:42:56.030 --> 00:42:56.460
There are few

00:42:56.550 --> 00:42:57.980
I truly wish to kill in this world,

00:42:59.230 --> 00:42:59.980
but sadly,

00:43:01.670 --> 00:43:03.050
you are one of them.

00:43:40.480 --> 00:43:40.980
Don't be afraid.

00:43:47.070 --> 00:43:47.780
Find a place

00:43:49.110 --> 00:43:50.300
and hide with your companions.

00:43:51.670 --> 00:43:52.340
This conflict

00:43:54.230 --> 00:43:55.340
will probably last a long time.

00:44:10.280 --> 00:44:11.980
It seems the Xuanwu Guardian of Tianqi City

00:44:12.710 --> 00:44:13.940
is not so hard to deal with after all.

00:44:18.550 --> 00:44:20.420
Our Tang Clan does not fear the Lei Fortress.

00:44:21.230 --> 00:44:21.900
Likewise,

00:44:22.590 --> 00:44:24.170
I'm not afraid of your Thunder Orbs either.

00:44:28.320 --> 00:44:29.010
Move again,

00:44:29.920 --> 00:44:31.170
and I will have no choice but to kill you.

00:44:40.760 --> 00:44:43.090
I heard there was once the blood of a prince

00:44:43.760 --> 00:44:45.260
on your Fingertip Blade.

00:44:46.920 --> 00:44:48.650
Why are you now

00:44:49.000 --> 00:44:50.380
so hesitant to kill?

00:44:51.280 --> 00:44:52.260
I don't wish to kill,

00:44:53.230 --> 00:44:54.690
even if you are from Blood River.

00:44:56.960 --> 00:44:57.860
I thought

00:44:58.400 --> 00:45:00.340
it was your love of beauty

00:45:01.150 --> 00:45:02.260
that held you back.

00:45:07.230 --> 00:45:08.050
Silly.

00:45:19.800 --> 00:45:21.460
I've long heard that the Mu family of Blood River

00:45:21.760 --> 00:45:22.980
excels in trickery.

00:45:23.480 --> 00:45:24.170
Today I see

00:45:24.760 --> 00:45:25.530
that it is true.

00:45:26.150 --> 00:45:27.610
In the Pipa Pavilion of Jiujiang,

00:45:28.320 --> 00:45:29.650
you, Tang Lianyue of the Tang Clan,

00:45:30.510 --> 00:45:32.650
became famed across the land with three hidden weapons.

00:45:33.030 --> 00:45:34.340
I have

00:45:34.670 --> 00:45:36.050
long admired you as well.

00:45:36.630 --> 00:45:38.210
I shouldn't have shown you mercy earlier.

00:45:38.920 --> 00:45:39.940
Now I'm caught in your bewitching spell.

00:45:40.590 --> 00:45:41.260
Bewitching spell?

00:45:43.360 --> 00:45:44.170
What do you mean?

00:45:45.190 --> 00:45:46.010
You know

00:45:46.710 --> 00:45:48.090
I rose to fame in Jiujiang's Pipa Pavilion

00:45:48.710 --> 00:45:50.490
with three hidden weapons,

00:45:51.320 --> 00:45:52.340
but do you know

00:45:53.400 --> 00:45:55.260
which three they are?

00:45:56.480 --> 00:45:58.170
Rumor says

00:45:59.000 --> 00:46:02.380
you forged all three yourself.

00:46:03.400 --> 00:46:04.780
But I haven't heard

00:46:05.840 --> 00:46:06.820
what they are exactly.

00:46:07.590 --> 00:46:08.420
No need to know beforehand.

00:46:08.920 --> 00:46:10.300
You will see them soon enough.

00:46:11.230 --> 00:46:11.740
Don't move.

00:46:13.630 --> 00:46:14.170
If you move again,

00:46:15.670 --> 00:46:16.860
my spiders

00:46:17.550 --> 00:46:18.650
will turn you

00:46:18.710 --> 00:46:19.340
into an ice statue.

00:46:20.320 --> 00:46:21.780
If I add in a few Netherworld Spiders,

00:46:22.760 --> 00:46:23.940
you will be blown

00:46:24.110 --> 00:46:25.090
to nothing.

00:46:25.920 --> 00:46:26.980
I'd like to see you try.

00:46:43.880 --> 00:46:44.780
This is the first

00:46:44.800 --> 00:46:46.340
of those three hidden weapons,

00:46:47.280 --> 00:46:48.570
