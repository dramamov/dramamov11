00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:35.360
This one.

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:36.719
This one.

00:02:36.719 --> 00:02:37.719
And this one.

00:02:39.639 --> 00:02:42.639
These ingredients all look expensive.

00:02:42.639 --> 00:02:43.879
There's abalone, too.

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:47.400
I've been saving these for a long time.

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:49.120
I've wanted to eat them for ages.

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:50.159
Alright.

00:02:50.319 --> 00:02:51.240
It's a birthday party.

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:52.360
If the meal costs a bit more,

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:53.159
that's fine.

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:54.159
Exactly.

00:02:54.159 --> 00:02:55.599
Look, it's our birthday.

00:02:55.599 --> 00:02:57.199
A beautiful girl celebrating her birthday.

00:02:57.199 --> 00:02:57.800
One year older.

00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:59.240
Think of it as compensation.

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:00.360
Okay.

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:01.919
But Li Zhenggui,

00:03:02.039 --> 00:03:04.159
you can only pick three dishes.

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:05.080
Three?

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:09.120
That's... really hard to choose.

00:03:15.479 --> 00:03:16.280
Take these.

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:23.319
These three.

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:25.120
Don't show me.

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:27.319
Why?

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:28.479
It's a birthday party.

00:03:28.479 --> 00:03:29.759
Leave some suspense.

00:03:29.759 --> 00:03:30.879
I want a surprise.

00:03:32.759 --> 00:03:33.680
Li Zhenggui.

00:03:33.919 --> 00:03:35.360
It's Nian'er's birthday.

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:38.120
So it's Nian'er's birthday party.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:40.280
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:03:41.199 --> 00:03:42.599
What's mine is hers.

00:03:42.599 --> 00:03:43.560
What's hers is mine.

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:44.560
That's what best friends do.

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:48.439
See you at dinner.

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:53.280
Why don't you pick one too?

00:03:55.479 --> 00:03:57.560
You're pregnant, is there anything you want?

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:05.719
Nian'er.

00:04:05.719 --> 00:04:06.280
Cong-ge.

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:07.199
There's a big project tonight.

00:04:07.199 --> 00:04:08.319
You have to stay.

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:09.560
You know how it is.

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:11.560
Some celebrities like to be late now.

00:04:11.719 --> 00:04:12.439
No, Cong-ge,

00:04:12.439 --> 00:04:13.120
I have something today—

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:13.960
I'm parking now.

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:14.960
I'm downstairs.

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:15.520
Coming, coming.

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:17.120
It's really important.

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:21.560
Here we go again.

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:23.639
Nian'er.

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:25.439
Why aren't you home yet?

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:26.879
Hurry up!

00:04:26.879 --> 00:04:28.199
We can't wait any longer

00:04:28.879 --> 00:04:31.360
to celebrate your birthday.

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:32.120
Hui.

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:34.439
She got off work extra early.

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:37.720
Li Zhenggui.

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:38.720
Sorry.

00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:40.879
I might have to work late tonight.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:42.480
You and Hui don't need to wait for me.

00:04:42.879 --> 00:04:44.279
How about we postpone until tomorrow?

00:04:46.439 --> 00:04:49.000
You can't postpone a birthday to tomorrow!

00:04:51.279 --> 00:04:53.079
I really can't help it.

00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:54.839
How about this—

00:04:54.839 --> 00:04:57.000
You two use the emergency fund

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:58.240
and go eat something nice outside.

00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:00.040
Sorry.

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:10.079
Nian'er is so unreliable.

00:05:22.639 --> 00:05:24.240
You can't blame Nian'er for this.

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:26.079
That's just how work is.

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:29.360
I stayed up all night

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:30.800
just for tonight's feast.

00:05:31.519 --> 00:05:33.800
Stop thinking only about your feast.

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:34.720
Don't forget,

00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:36.240
today is Nian'er's birthday.

00:05:42.639 --> 00:05:44.759
If she can't cook,

00:05:44.879 --> 00:05:46.160
we can buy the ingredients ourselves

00:05:46.199 --> 00:05:47.399
and cook ourselves.

00:05:51.639 --> 00:05:52.560
You think so too,

00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:54.360
but it sounds unreliable, right?

00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:01.519
Can't cook.

00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:04.079
Then let's make a birthday cake.

00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:07.000
Look over here.

00:06:07.399 --> 00:06:11.199
I've got a bunch of cake recipes saved.

00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:12.399
They're all here.

00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:14.480
Let's go.

00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:16.040
Change clothes, change clothes!

00:06:46.120 --> 00:06:47.680
Surprise!

00:06:54.079 --> 00:06:55.519
Happy birthday!

00:06:56.079 --> 00:06:57.079
How did you—

00:06:57.639 --> 00:06:58.639
Are you surprised?

00:06:58.800 --> 00:06:59.600
But—

00:07:00.040 --> 00:07:02.079
We have to thank Yin Zhanqi for opening the door.

00:07:02.639 --> 00:07:03.480
Happy birthday!

00:07:03.600 --> 00:07:04.399
Thank you.

00:07:05.399 --> 00:07:06.199
Look,

00:07:06.240 --> 00:07:08.480
this cake isn't store-bought.

00:07:08.480 --> 00:07:10.959
Hui and I made it ourselves.

00:07:13.240 --> 00:07:14.959
You two made it?

00:07:16.279 --> 00:07:17.920
But Li Zhenggui did most of the work.

00:07:18.160 --> 00:07:19.240
Not really...

00:07:19.240 --> 00:07:20.759
But while we were making it,

00:07:20.759 --> 00:07:23.199
there were a few little mishaps.

00:07:23.199 --> 00:07:25.079
But it was worth it.

00:07:29.560 --> 00:07:30.519
Thank you both.

00:07:31.519 --> 00:07:32.319
It's your birthday.

00:07:32.319 --> 00:07:33.800
It's rare for us to show off our skills.

00:07:34.120 --> 00:07:34.800
Make a wish!

00:07:36.720 --> 00:07:37.399
Okay.

00:08:07.879 --> 00:08:08.360
Hello?

00:08:09.759 --> 00:08:10.279
Mom.

00:08:10.279 --> 00:08:11.560
I'm not home right now.

00:08:12.560 --> 00:08:13.079
Okay, okay.

00:08:13.079 --> 00:08:14.160
I'll call you later.

00:08:14.160 --> 00:08:14.800
Bye.

00:08:21.800 --> 00:08:22.600
Thank you.

00:08:27.480 --> 00:08:28.959
Is it good?

00:08:34.320 --> 00:08:35.240
Not bad.

00:08:35.320 --> 00:08:36.159
Yes.

00:08:36.759 --> 00:08:38.559
I told you it was good.

00:08:47.759 --> 00:08:48.559
Mom

00:08:48.600 --> 00:08:49.279
Li Zhenggui

00:08:49.279 --> 00:08:50.840
Long time no see.

00:08:50.960 --> 00:08:52.840
Come here, let me take a look.

00:08:53.440 --> 00:08:54.840
You finally gained some weight.

00:08:54.840 --> 00:08:56.240
Of course.

00:08:57.159 --> 00:08:58.480
Come, let's sit and talk.

00:09:01.120 --> 00:09:01.720
Mom

00:09:01.960 --> 00:09:03.000
Is there something you need?

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:04.039
Why did you ask me out?

00:09:08.919 --> 00:09:11.919
I need your help with something.

00:09:14.919 --> 00:09:17.720
What could I possibly help with?

00:09:21.320 --> 00:09:24.159
The ten percent shares you hold for me—

00:09:25.360 --> 00:09:29.039
Transfer them to me this month.

00:09:30.320 --> 00:09:31.320
Just for now.

00:09:34.240 --> 00:09:36.480
Is something wrong with the company?

00:09:36.480 --> 00:09:37.480
Nothing's wrong.

00:09:38.159 --> 00:09:40.159
Don't ask so many questions.

00:09:43.679 --> 00:09:46.039
Did you and Dad have a fight?

00:09:46.399 --> 00:09:47.440
If something's going on,

00:09:47.440 --> 00:09:49.240
just tell me directly.

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:54.960
Your dad and I—

00:09:56.759 --> 00:09:57.559
We...

00:09:59.559 --> 00:10:00.360
are divorced.

00:10:03.600 --> 00:10:04.399
Divorced?

00:10:07.360 --> 00:10:09.000
It's not April Fool's Day.

00:10:13.440 --> 00:10:16.480
I'm in a tough spot right now.

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:19.960
If even you won't help me,

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:22.759
things will be even harder for me.

00:10:23.879 --> 00:10:25.120
Wait, Mom—

00:10:25.799 --> 00:10:28.360
You and Dad have been together for years.

00:10:29.159 --> 00:10:30.399
Was it all fake?

00:10:30.559 --> 00:10:31.559
Decades as husband and wife—

00:10:31.559 --> 00:10:32.919
You just end it like that?

00:10:36.320 --> 00:10:37.159
Li Zhenggui,

00:10:37.559 --> 00:10:38.559
There are things

00:10:39.159 --> 00:10:40.879
I've never told you.

00:10:42.240 --> 00:10:43.759
When there's time,

00:10:43.879 --> 00:10:45.240
I'll explain it to you slowly.

00:10:45.240 --> 00:10:46.759
I don't need explanations.

00:10:46.759 --> 00:10:48.799
I just want a whole family.

00:10:49.759 --> 00:10:50.600
I know.

00:10:50.840 --> 00:10:52.200
Given the situation now,

00:10:52.279 --> 00:10:53.559
it's hard for you to accept.

00:10:53.679 --> 00:10:55.000
But you need to understand,

00:10:55.440 --> 00:10:57.159
people have to pay for their mistakes.

00:10:57.559 --> 00:10:58.639
There are consequences.

00:10:59.039 --> 00:11:00.559
I won't enable your dad anymore.

00:11:01.639 --> 00:11:04.039
Wait, what did Dad do wrong?

00:11:04.200 --> 00:11:07.360
Why do you want those shares?

00:11:07.360 --> 00:11:08.679
To kick him out of the company.

00:11:08.799 --> 00:11:10.240
You only tell me after the divorce?

00:11:10.240 --> 00:11:12.279
What do you take me for?

00:11:15.120 --> 00:11:15.960
Your dad—

00:11:16.440 --> 00:11:17.919
He cheated on me.

00:11:18.440 --> 00:11:20.120
He wants me out of the company too.

00:11:21.960 --> 00:11:23.320
What am I supposed to do?

00:11:40.679 --> 00:11:42.480
I need some time.

00:11:44.559 --> 00:11:45.320
Li Zhenggui,

00:11:46.759 --> 00:11:48.879
I need a little time.

00:11:52.240 --> 00:11:53.039
Li Zhenggui...

00:12:08.519 --> 00:12:11.039
Why has Li Zhenggui been gone so long?

00:12:17.320 --> 00:12:18.080
She's back.

00:12:19.080 --> 00:12:19.879
Come here!

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:22.039
We saved a piece of cake for you.

00:12:50.519 --> 00:12:51.320
Are you hungry?

00:12:56.879 --> 00:12:58.720
It's fine if you don't want cake.

00:12:58.720 --> 00:13:00.000
I'll make you something else.

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:01.120
What do you want to eat?

00:13:01.559 --> 00:13:02.519
I'm not hungry.

00:13:18.799 --> 00:13:19.600
Have some water.

00:13:23.440 --> 00:13:24.240
Right.

00:13:24.279 --> 00:13:26.759
Your dad just sent you a delivery.

00:13:28.399 --> 00:13:29.200
Take a look.

00:13:39.080 --> 00:13:40.480
You lost your bank card.

00:13:49.159 --> 00:13:50.960
This is my dad's supplementary gold card.

00:13:52.080 --> 00:13:53.320
Why did your dad suddenly

00:13:53.320 --> 00:13:55.279
give you his own credit card?

00:13:56.159 --> 00:13:58.000
Because I'm their bargaining chip now.

00:14:06.120 --> 00:14:06.960
I'm fine.

00:14:08.080 --> 00:14:08.879
I'm tired.

00:14:08.960 --> 00:14:09.759
I'm going to bed.

00:14:10.480 --> 00:14:11.279
Don't worry.

00:14:12.399 --> 00:14:13.240
Good night.

00:14:26.720 --> 00:14:29.399
She just said "bargaining chip."

00:14:30.600 --> 00:14:31.679
I think so.

00:14:56.159 --> 00:14:57.320
My mom told me

00:14:57.600 --> 00:14:58.360
Li Zhenggui's parents

00:14:58.360 --> 00:14:59.840
are getting divorced now.

00:14:59.840 --> 00:15:01.639
It even went to court.

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:05.440
Parents suddenly become enemies.

00:15:05.960 --> 00:15:07.600
Li Zhenggui must feel awful.

00:15:08.960 --> 00:15:11.039
Look at her these days.

00:15:11.200 --> 00:15:12.840
She spends every day at the bar.

00:15:13.639 --> 00:15:14.480
She won't come home

00:15:14.480 --> 00:15:15.840
unless she's drunk.

00:15:16.159 --> 00:15:17.799
She's so self-destructive now.

00:15:17.799 --> 00:15:18.440
I...

00:15:18.559 --> 00:15:20.000
It makes me angry to see her like this.

00:15:21.240 --> 00:15:22.679
I understand how she feels.

00:15:23.039 --> 00:15:25.080
She can't solve this problem.

00:15:25.159 --> 00:15:27.200
She can only escape by drinking.

00:15:28.720 --> 00:15:29.799
Does running away help?

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:31.080
Does drinking help?

00:15:31.080 --> 00:15:33.080
She's only hurting herself in the end.

00:15:35.279 --> 00:15:37.000
She's so down and out now.

00:15:37.200 --> 00:15:38.440
I really should scold her.

00:15:38.440 --> 00:15:39.960
Don't scold her.

00:15:40.279 --> 00:15:41.519
Especially now,

00:15:41.639 --> 00:15:43.960
we should be understanding and patient.

00:15:44.440 --> 00:15:45.240
Otherwise,

00:15:45.480 --> 00:15:46.320
tonight,

00:15:46.320 --> 00:15:47.559
let's make something tasty.

00:15:47.559 --> 00:15:49.000
Talk to her, cheer her up.

00:15:50.919 --> 00:15:52.120
That's all we can do.

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:03.039
Young people nowadays

00:16:03.200 --> 00:16:04.240
face all kinds

00:16:04.240 --> 00:16:05.440
of uncertainty in life.

00:16:05.879 --> 00:16:08.039
A little humor, a lot of composure—

00:16:09.080 --> 00:16:10.279
that's how they cope.

00:16:10.879 --> 00:16:11.840
I've tried.

00:16:11.840 --> 00:16:12.679
I've let go.

00:16:12.679 --> 00:16:13.960
I've made peace.

00:16:14.519 --> 00:16:16.440
In short, no self-torment.

00:16:17.279 --> 00:16:19.600
Today, I'll make a vegetarian

00:16:19.600 --> 00:16:20.919
Vegetarian Sukiyaki.

00:16:21.240 --> 00:16:22.879
With this gentle sweetness,

00:16:23.159 --> 00:16:25.000
to soothe Li Zhenggui's hangover.

00:16:25.759 --> 00:16:26.720
I hope

00:16:26.720 --> 00:16:28.399
it can also comfort

00:16:28.600 --> 00:16:30.320
her restless heart.

00:18:09.039 --> 00:18:10.119
Sukiyaki...

00:18:10.440 --> 00:18:11.440
Looks delicious.

00:18:11.640 --> 00:18:13.599
This is vegetarian Sukiyaki.

00:18:13.599 --> 00:18:15.119
Also called Vegetarian Sukiyaki.

00:18:19.440 --> 00:18:22.000
Buddha-like, that's nice.

00:18:23.680 --> 00:18:25.440
Buddha-like means not worrying.

00:18:25.440 --> 00:18:26.839
No need to think about anything.

00:18:27.799 --> 00:18:29.680
Just go with the flow for a day.

00:18:30.440 --> 00:18:32.559
Let Li Zhenggui have a drink for a day.

00:18:49.559 --> 00:18:50.359
Eat up.

00:18:50.519 --> 00:18:51.359
Let's dig in.

00:21:13.240 --> 00:21:14.160
Stop drinking.

00:21:15.720 --> 00:21:17.480
Look at yourself right now.

00:21:17.799 --> 00:21:19.400
Your dark circles are almost on the floor.

00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:21.200
Isn't that great?

00:21:21.200 --> 00:21:23.000
No need for eyeshadow now.

00:21:26.240 --> 00:21:28.079
Fine, I won't drink anymore.

00:21:29.240 --> 00:21:31.680
My problems are none of your business.

00:21:32.440 --> 00:21:35.480
I'm tangping—it's my choice, my life.

00:21:40.559 --> 00:21:41.359
Li Zhenggui

00:21:41.359 --> 00:21:43.759
Avoiding problems won't solve anything.

00:21:43.799 --> 00:21:45.000
You still have the two of us.

00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:46.680
If the sky falls, we'll face it together.

00:21:50.920 --> 00:21:52.119
There's no alcohol at home.

00:21:52.119 --> 00:21:53.359
I'm going out for a drink.

00:21:53.559 --> 00:21:54.359
Oh, right.

00:21:55.319 --> 00:21:56.119
Tomorrow.

00:21:56.279 --> 00:21:57.279
Is Auntie

00:21:57.279 --> 00:22:00.200
meeting your ex's parents to talk?

00:22:03.599 --> 00:22:05.000
Good luck to you both.

00:22:05.400 --> 00:22:06.319
Li Zhenggui

00:22:06.319 --> 00:22:07.400
Hui

00:22:07.519 --> 00:22:09.160
Let her have some time alone.

00:22:14.799 --> 00:22:16.799
I understand what both of you mean.

00:22:44.279 --> 00:22:45.079
Mom.

00:22:46.680 --> 00:22:48.440
The reason I didn't let you join

00:22:48.799 --> 00:22:49.599
is because

00:22:50.359 --> 00:22:51.200
I know

00:22:52.519 --> 00:22:54.200
you wanted to protect me.

00:22:57.039 --> 00:22:58.599
His parents are decent people.

00:22:59.519 --> 00:23:01.799
They also criticized Runze.

00:23:02.799 --> 00:23:03.759
They also said

00:23:06.799 --> 00:23:07.599
What did they say?

00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:11.839
His mom said they could compensate you.

00:23:12.960 --> 00:23:14.240
I don't want their compensation.

00:23:17.160 --> 00:23:18.319
Let me finish, listen to me.

00:23:20.119 --> 00:23:20.920
They said

00:23:21.480 --> 00:23:22.640
they'd give you some money.

00:23:24.279 --> 00:23:25.839
As for the child,

00:23:27.839 --> 00:23:28.839
it's up to you to decide.

00:23:31.920 --> 00:23:33.240
They said you're still young.

00:23:33.240 --> 00:23:34.559
Don't let the child

00:23:34.920 --> 00:23:36.119
hold back your future.

00:23:42.759 --> 00:23:45.920
They really said that.

00:23:51.279 --> 00:23:52.079
Hui

00:23:53.240 --> 00:23:54.240
Listen to me, Hui.

00:23:54.799 --> 00:23:56.599
We don't need to care what others think.

00:23:58.000 --> 00:23:59.920
Just live our own lives well.

00:23:59.920 --> 00:24:01.519
As long as your conscience is clear.

00:24:04.400 --> 00:24:05.799
Always remember,

00:24:09.480 --> 00:24:11.079
no matter what you decide,

00:24:12.039 --> 00:24:13.000
your dad and I

00:24:13.640 --> 00:24:15.599
will always be your strongest support.

00:24:25.240 --> 00:24:26.200
Don't cry.

00:24:26.759 --> 00:24:27.920
We're all adults now.

00:24:35.559 --> 00:24:36.480
No more tears, okay?

00:24:53.160 --> 00:24:54.119
Hui

00:25:09.720 --> 00:25:10.680
Let's go home first.

00:25:26.079 --> 00:25:27.000
How are you feeling?

00:25:27.200 --> 00:25:28.839
Why didn't Auntie come back with you?

00:25:31.119 --> 00:25:32.839
My mom wanted to take care of my dad.

00:25:32.960 --> 00:25:34.000
She went back.

00:25:40.160 --> 00:25:41.559
My mind is a mess right now.

00:25:45.240 --> 00:25:46.680
I really don't know what to do.

00:25:51.599 --> 00:25:52.440
Li Zhenggui

00:25:53.240 --> 00:25:54.440
Still no news?

00:25:55.519 --> 00:25:56.839
Li Zhenggui messaged me.

00:25:56.839 --> 00:25:58.000
She said she's staying at a hotel.

00:25:58.319 --> 00:25:59.559
She wants to be alone.

00:25:59.559 --> 00:26:00.880
She asked us not to bother her.

00:26:06.759 --> 00:26:08.839
Looks like she doesn't want to come back yet.

00:26:13.599 --> 00:26:15.680
If something ends badly,

00:26:15.839 --> 00:26:17.759
it means it's not truly over.

00:26:17.960 --> 00:26:19.599
All we can do now

00:26:19.839 --> 00:26:20.960
is wait.

00:26:26.599 --> 00:26:27.839
You should rest for a bit.

00:26:27.839 --> 00:26:29.000
I'll go make you dinner.

00:26:31.200 --> 00:26:32.039
Don't bother.

00:26:32.319 --> 00:26:33.119
I'm not hungry.

00:26:33.839 --> 00:26:35.039
Hungry or not,

00:26:35.039 --> 00:26:36.680
you still need to eat dinner.

00:26:40.519 --> 00:26:43.720
It's for him to eat.

00:27:15.200 --> 00:27:16.559
Everything's tidied up.

00:27:19.799 --> 00:27:20.599
See?

00:27:21.240 --> 00:27:22.880
I finally got a chance

00:27:22.880 --> 00:27:24.640
to clean up her mess.

00:27:25.599 --> 00:27:27.680
Isn't everything back in order now?

00:27:29.680 --> 00:27:31.359
Chaos is a kind of order too.

00:27:36.039 --> 00:27:36.960
I promise,

00:27:37.240 --> 00:27:38.440
once she's back,

00:27:38.440 --> 00:27:39.640
in less than a day,

00:27:39.839 --> 00:27:41.880
it'll be messy again.

00:27:45.599 --> 00:27:46.799
That rascal Li Zhenggui.

00:27:46.799 --> 00:27:47.920
Hurry back, will you?

00:27:48.519 --> 00:27:49.920
The house is suddenly so quiet.

00:27:50.359 --> 00:27:51.519
I'm not used to it.

00:27:54.440 --> 00:27:55.240
Nian'er

00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:00.279
I'm planning to quit my job.

00:28:02.920 --> 00:28:03.839
Quit?

00:28:04.440 --> 00:28:05.680
Have the baby.

00:28:06.440 --> 00:28:08.160
Then you really shouldn't quit.

00:28:08.359 --> 00:28:09.079
Without a job,

00:28:09.079 --> 00:28:09.720
no income,

00:28:09.720 --> 00:28:10.960
how will you raise the child?

00:28:20.240 --> 00:28:21.440
I've saved up some money.

00:28:21.559 --> 00:28:23.440
It should last for a while.

00:28:23.640 --> 00:28:25.839
Didn't I just get promoted?

00:28:25.960 --> 00:28:27.640
My workload increased a lot.

00:28:28.960 --> 00:28:30.640
With my current health,

00:28:30.640 --> 00:28:32.240
I can barely manage.

00:28:32.599 --> 00:28:34.200
But as the months go by,

00:28:34.240 --> 00:28:35.119
this workload

00:28:35.119 --> 00:28:36.519
I definitely can't keep up.

00:28:36.519 --> 00:28:38.400
Then talk to the company,

00:28:38.400 --> 00:28:38.920
see if you can

00:28:38.920 --> 00:28:40.039
reduce your workload a bit.

00:28:40.039 --> 00:28:42.440
Even though the company fired Li Yihan,

00:28:42.720 --> 00:28:45.400
the competition is still fierce.

00:28:46.519 --> 00:28:47.640
I'm quitting.

00:28:47.640 --> 00:28:49.920
Plenty of people want my position.

00:28:51.440 --> 00:28:52.240
So,

00:28:52.519 --> 00:28:53.880
instead of waiting for the company

00:28:53.880 --> 00:28:55.599
to find a reason to fire me,

00:28:55.880 --> 00:28:57.799
I'd rather resign myself.

00:28:57.799 --> 00:28:59.519
But you're pregnant!

00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:02.240
Online they keep saying birth rates are low.

00:29:02.440 --> 00:29:04.519
Shouldn't companies care more for pregnant women?

00:29:06.319 --> 00:29:08.240
A company isn't a charity.

00:29:08.720 --> 00:29:10.319
They won't pay people to do nothing.

00:29:10.319 --> 00:29:11.079
Besides,

00:29:11.519 --> 00:29:13.160
since I got pregnant,

00:29:13.440 --> 00:29:15.839
I realized promotions, raises, cars, houses—

00:29:15.839 --> 00:29:17.000
for me,

00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:19.079
they don't seem that appealing anymore.

00:29:25.799 --> 00:29:27.200
Honestly, I've thought about this for a long time.

00:29:29.480 --> 00:29:30.440
If I have to

00:29:30.440 --> 00:29:31.720
choose between work and my child,

00:29:31.720 --> 00:29:32.960
make a choice,

00:29:34.960 --> 00:29:37.000
I'd choose my child without hesitation.

00:29:43.960 --> 00:29:44.759
Alright then.

00:29:45.599 --> 00:29:47.440
Since you've made up your mind,

00:29:47.720 --> 00:29:48.599
I support you.

00:29:50.720 --> 00:29:51.599
Don't worry.

00:29:51.839 --> 00:29:52.839
You still have me.

00:29:53.440 --> 00:29:55.119
I'll make sure you and the baby

00:29:55.119 --> 00:29:57.319
are both healthy and chubby.

00:30:05.839 --> 00:30:06.720
Nian'er

00:30:08.559 --> 00:30:09.599
I'm planning

00:30:11.079 --> 00:30:12.359
to go home and get ready for the baby.

00:30:14.400 --> 00:30:15.720
You're going back home?

00:30:17.240 --> 00:30:19.079
My parents are getting older.

00:30:20.240 --> 00:30:21.599
I've been out here on my own

00:30:21.839 --> 00:30:23.039
working hard for so long,

00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:25.839
rarely having time with them.

00:30:28.039 --> 00:30:28.880
Now that I'm having a child,

00:30:28.880 --> 00:30:30.200
I suddenly understand

00:30:30.200 --> 00:30:32.279
my mom's concern for me.

00:30:35.440 --> 00:30:38.000
So I plan to return to my hometown

00:30:38.480 --> 00:30:39.480
and be with my parents

00:30:39.480 --> 00:30:41.319
to welcome this new baby together.

00:30:53.680 --> 00:30:55.200
Yin Zhanqi

00:30:56.319 --> 00:30:57.480
is a really good person.

00:30:58.839 --> 00:31:01.240
Yin Zhanqi truly is a good guy.

00:31:02.440 --> 00:31:04.079
But I've come to realize

00:31:05.400 --> 00:31:08.000
marriage and love aren't the same.

00:31:08.720 --> 00:31:09.599
Maybe Yin Zhanqi

00:31:09.599 --> 00:31:11.960
is someone very suitable for marriage,

00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:15.599
but he doesn't truly love me.

00:31:16.240 --> 00:31:17.920
He seems to treat you really well.

00:31:18.160 --> 00:31:20.039
He wants to cherish you above all else.

00:31:23.640 --> 00:31:25.400
The day after my birthday,

00:31:26.440 --> 00:31:28.839
he tried to ask my colleagues about my age.

00:31:31.599 --> 00:31:33.599
After he found out how old I am,

00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:35.440
he said,

00:31:37.400 --> 00:31:39.000
"If you don't have a baby soon, it'll be too late."

00:31:42.759 --> 00:31:45.039
There are other details, but I won't get into them.

00:31:46.119 --> 00:31:47.359
In his eyes,

00:31:48.039 --> 00:31:49.680
I'm a good wife and mother,

00:31:50.079 --> 00:31:51.680
someone fit for marriage,

00:31:52.680 --> 00:31:54.240
but not Liang Nian'er herself.

00:31:58.079 --> 00:32:00.160
This isn't a path I have to take.

00:32:03.240 --> 00:32:04.559
So I decided

00:32:05.160 --> 00:32:07.240
before we ever got together,

00:32:08.559 --> 00:32:09.359
to turn him down.

00:32:12.559 --> 00:32:14.359
I already turned him down yesterday.
