(I'll Fight the Zhao Sisters

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:19.120
Greetings, Your Highness Consort Jing.

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:21.280
Rise.

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:23.960
Noble Lady Zhao,
how is your foot recovering?

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:25.720
Thank you for your concern.

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:27.160
I have nearly recovered.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:28.896
Be seated.

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:33.240
I hear Noble Lady Yun
employs remarkable methods.

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.680
She lured His Majesty
to a midnight boat tryst...

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:36.720
What?

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:37.632
How utterly...

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.320
Noble Lady Yun

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:41.568
needs but to make her move

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:42.960
to upheave the entire harem.

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:44.760
We'd all better stay vigilant.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.800
Don't claim I neglected warning you
when misfortune strikes.

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:52.200
Greetings to Consort Jing,

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:53.200
Consort Wan,

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:54.800
and Concubine Shu.

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:59.360
Be seated.

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:00.640
Thank you, Your Highness.

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:03.640
Noble Lady Yun
is newly elevated by His Majesty

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:05.360
and granted Yongxiu Palace.

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:07.240
From this day forth,

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:08.760
we're all sisters in harmony.

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:11.880
They say Noble Lady Yun's wit dazzles,

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:13.480
and she's favored by His Majesty.

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:16.000
We crude-minded sisters

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:18.400
must learn from you henceforth.

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:20.680
You flatter me, Concubine Shu.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:22.840
In this harem,

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:24.560
clever talents abound.

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:26.240
Yet

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:27.720
imperial favor flows like water,

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:29.040
and no flower blooms forever.

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:30.520
His Majesty

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:31.920
merely seeks novelty.

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:34.200
Those competing through vulgar means

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:36.240
will find imperial favor fleeting.

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:38.520
Imperial favor flows like water,

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:39.840
and no flower blooms forever.

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:41.344
Well said.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.640
Noble Lady Zhao,
you recently offended His Majesty.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:45.840
Next time,

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:47.200
you should do better.

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:54.560
Noble Lady Yun, you seem familiar.

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:56.880
Have we met before?

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:58.760
Noble Lady Rong, you have a keen memory.

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:00.640
Noble Lady Yun

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:02.640
was merely a lowly maid

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.600
from the Servitude Bureau
serving superiors.

00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:09.360
In this imperial harem,

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:11.840
are we not all servants
serving His Majesty?

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:13.720
Serving with devotion

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:16.000
to win imperial favor is true skill.

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:17.600
Enough.

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:19.360
We're all sisters here.

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:20.880
Let's maintain harmony.

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:22.840
Don't engage in petty squabbles.

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:29.640
May endless fortune bless you.

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:32.480
Consort Jing
congratulates your coronation

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:35.760
with a pair of pearl phoenix hairpins
from East Sea tributes.

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:38.880
Thank you, Your Highness.

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:43.392
Greetings, Your Ladyship.

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:45.520
Noble Lady Zhao also prepares

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:47.320
a filigree enamel bracelet for you.

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:49.920
Thank you, Noble Lady Zhao.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:55.008
Greetings, Your Ladyship.

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:57.880
Consort Wan congratulates
your residency at Yongxiu Palace

00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:00.800
with a geranium hair ornament.

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:10.160
Thank you, Your Highness.

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:16.120
You are all thoughtful.

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:17.560
Hereby,

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:18.880
I thank you all.

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:20.680
Noble Lady Yun,

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:21.960
should leisure permit,

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:23.880
visit other palaces more often.

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:26.360
Company benefits us all.

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:28.448
Yes.

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:35.160
The geranium's fragrance is distinctive.

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:37.440
Its fragrance permeates the container.

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:40.720
It's my first time seeing foreign flora.

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:42.240
Consort Wan's gift

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:43.760
is truly unconventional.

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:54.600
Does Your Ladyship sense impropriety?

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:57.000
Palace rules strictly dictate:

00:03:57.840 --> 00:03:59.160
concubines offer hair ornaments,

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:00.600
and empresses offer hairpins.

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:02.680
Rarer blossoms

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:04.400
signify higher station.

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:06.440
Consort Wan outranks me,

00:04:06.528 --> 00:04:07.640
yet she gifts me

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:09.680
this precious geranium hair ornament.

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:11.840
That's very strange.

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:13.440
Shall I

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:14.760
dispose of it covertly?

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:16.480
No need.

00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:17.880
I anticipate her opening gambit.

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:25.504
Wait here.

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:34.720
Chief Wu.

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:44.080
Greetings, Your Ladyship.

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:45.880
No one else is here.

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:47.392
No need to be formal.

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:52.600
Your Ladyship and I are worlds apart.

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:53.984
So I wouldn't dare.

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:55.872
How may I help?

00:04:56.480 --> 00:04:57.320
Consort Wan

00:04:57.320 --> 00:04:59.040
gifted me
a geranium hair ornament today.

00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:01.840
I'm unsure if there's
hidden meaning behind this.

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:03.520
Geraniums are rare.

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:04.832
Hair ornaments with them

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:07.040
should be crafted
by Imperial Workshops artisans.

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:09.000
All steps comply with rules

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:10.320
and are overseen.

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:12.064
There should be no issues.

00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:13.792
Thank you.

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:15.488
Chief Wu,

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:17.960
the Zhao sisters'

00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:20.400
actions today were truly peculiar.

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:22.240
I don't know

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:23.520
what their other moves might be.

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:26.432
Noble Lady Yun,

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:28.960
you now preside over your own palace.

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:30.520
The higher you are,

00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:31.440
the fiercer the winds.

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:33.400
You must be

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:34.840
fully prepared beforehand for all.

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:36.896
Chief Wu,

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:38.120
could you investigate

00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:40.120
any recent issues at Zhongning Palace?

00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:46.720
Stop now.

00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:48.080
Don't cause more trouble.

00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:50.112
Stop now?

00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:52.000
My vengeance remains.

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:52.928
How can I stop now?

00:05:53.184 --> 00:05:54.120
It's now a fight

00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:56.200
to the death
between me and the Zhao sisters.

00:05:57.120 --> 00:05:57.984
If I stop now,

00:05:58.520 --> 00:05:59.640
I'll be doomed eternally.

00:06:04.352 --> 00:06:05.216
Never mind.

00:06:06.304 --> 00:06:07.200
Forget it.

00:06:23.936 --> 00:06:25.120
Greetings,

00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:26.000
Your Ladyship.

00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:27.776
Rise.

00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:29.024
Thank you.

00:06:29.480 --> 00:06:31.440
I'd like to commission
some floral pastries.

00:06:31.960 --> 00:06:34.160
Make a few using this fresh geranium.

00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:42.080
Rest assured.

00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:44.080
You'll have satisfactory pastries
by tomorrow.

00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:45.792
One more thing.

00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:47.520
Can you use alternative materials

00:06:47.640 --> 00:06:49.280
to carve into a geranium shape?

00:06:49.880 --> 00:06:51.160
Make it identical to real ones.

00:06:51.880 --> 00:06:52.992
Can you do it?

00:06:56.320 --> 00:06:57.360
Yes.

00:06:57.360 --> 00:06:58.360
Thanks for your reward.

00:06:58.720 --> 00:07:00.040
We'll carve it meticulously,

00:07:00.480 --> 00:07:01.960
guaranteed to deceive the eye.

00:07:03.520 --> 00:07:05.200
What Her Ladyship commissioned today

00:07:05.640 --> 00:07:06.688
must stay confidential.

00:07:06.880 --> 00:07:07.776
Understood?

00:07:08.080 --> 00:07:09.024
Absolutely.

00:07:09.560 --> 00:07:11.280
I won't breathe a word.

00:07:15.320 --> 00:07:16.352
Take care, Your Ladyship.

00:07:17.984 --> 00:07:19.000
Your Ladyship,

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:20.560
why turn the real flower into pastries

00:07:21.120 --> 00:07:23.080
and painstakingly create a fake one?

00:07:24.680 --> 00:07:26.720
What secrets
the geranium hair ornament holds

00:07:26.720 --> 00:07:27.720
remains unclear.

00:07:28.080 --> 00:07:29.000
To be cautious,

00:07:29.480 --> 00:07:30.440
it shouldn't be worn.

00:07:32.040 --> 00:07:33.480
To avoid alerting the Zhao sisters

00:07:33.680 --> 00:07:35.000
and letting them notice

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:36.880
my suspicion
about the geranium hair ornament,

00:07:37.880 --> 00:07:39.240
I must pretend to wear it.

00:07:40.960 --> 00:07:43.160
So the fake one
is your contingency plan.

00:07:44.240 --> 00:07:46.680
Tomorrow I'll return
the geranium pastries

00:07:46.760 --> 00:07:47.760
to Consort Wan herself.

00:07:48.640 --> 00:07:49.880
Let's see what trick

00:07:50.280 --> 00:07:51.480
she's really playing.

00:07:55.040 --> 00:07:55.960
Today's gathering

00:07:55.960 --> 00:07:57.720
calls all of you here to discuss

00:07:57.880 --> 00:08:00.240
Her Majesty the Empress Dowager's
birthday celebrations.

00:08:00.880 --> 00:08:01.960
Who's missing?

00:08:02.880 --> 00:08:05.160
The newly titled Noble Lady Yun
is absent.

00:08:05.560 --> 00:08:07.160
Noble Lady Zhao hasn't arrived either.

00:08:07.680 --> 00:08:08.520
Your Highnesses,

00:08:08.760 --> 00:08:09.680
sorry I'm late.

00:08:18.160 --> 00:08:19.120
Consort Wan,

00:08:19.120 --> 00:08:20.200
Consort Jing,

00:08:20.400 --> 00:08:21.360
may fortune bless you.

00:08:22.280 --> 00:08:23.328
You may rise.

00:08:25.240 --> 00:08:26.360
Noble Lady Yun,

00:08:26.360 --> 00:08:27.480
newly elevated as you are,

00:08:28.040 --> 00:08:30.040
you should adhere strictly
to palace rules.

00:08:30.680 --> 00:08:33.400
You all sent me gifts days ago.

00:08:33.480 --> 00:08:35.080
I haven't properly acknowledged each.

00:08:35.480 --> 00:08:37.600
Today I've made floral pastries
with my own hands

00:08:37.600 --> 00:08:38.932
for you all

00:08:39.240 --> 00:08:40.080
as a humble gesture.

00:08:40.880 --> 00:08:41.920
Hence my delayed arrival.

00:08:42.480 --> 00:08:43.880
I beg Your Highnesses' forgiveness.

00:08:44.320 --> 00:08:46.600
Why did a noble lady like you
make flower pastries?

00:08:47.080 --> 00:08:48.400
Accustomed to serving others?

00:08:49.080 --> 00:08:50.120
To those unaware,

00:08:50.120 --> 00:08:51.680
they'd think you're still a servant.

00:08:52.840 --> 00:08:54.680
After all, she made these
with her own hands.

00:08:55.760 --> 00:08:56.880
Let's at least try them.

00:09:08.680 --> 00:09:09.728
Your Highness,

00:09:09.880 --> 00:09:10.784
please have a taste.

00:09:23.040 --> 00:09:24.080
Enough.

00:09:24.080 --> 00:09:25.120
Be seated.

00:09:38.120 --> 00:09:39.280
Greetings to Consort Jing

00:09:39.440 --> 00:09:40.720
and Consort Wan.

00:09:41.480 --> 00:09:42.560
Rise.

00:09:42.560 --> 00:09:43.440
Thank you.

00:10:21.120 --> 00:10:22.016
Your Highness,

00:10:22.528 --> 00:10:23.600
your face...

00:10:23.600 --> 00:10:24.480
So much blood!

00:10:32.520 --> 00:10:33.480
With her injured face,

00:10:33.480 --> 00:10:34.656
she can't serve His Majesty.

00:10:34.880 --> 00:10:35.760
It's over.

00:10:35.760 --> 00:10:37.360
Consort Wan's proudest beauty is ruined.

00:10:37.680 --> 00:10:39.080
The harem dynamics will shift now.

00:10:41.680 --> 00:10:43.680
His Majesty arrives!
