10:42.370 --> 10:45.330
<b>I'm gonna tear this whole building apart.</b>

10:45.330 --> 10:47.870
<b>Like you could do that with that skinny stick.</b>

10:47.870 --> 10:51.170
<b>Yeah? How 'bout I bust your head open instead?</b>

10:51.170 --> 10:54.420
<b>If you think you can, go ahead and try, pillbug head!</b>

10:55.130 --> 10:57.210
<b>Hurry up and get on with it.</b>

10:57.210 --> 11:00.180
<b>Otherwise Mr. Pompadour here is going to die.</b>

11:00.590 --> 11:03.930
<b>Hey, bobby pin, you siding with the girls?</b>

11:04.220 --> 11:08.180
<b>The great seer, Shibabawa-sama, is dead!</b>

11:08.430 --> 11:11.310
<b>Shibabawa? Was she killed?</b>

11:11.310 --> 11:11.810
<b>No.</b>

11:12.230 --> 11:15.070
<b>While looking into the future for the next six months,</b>

11:15.070 --> 11:17.570
<b>she became agitated and had a coughing fit.</b>

11:17.570 --> 11:20.320
<b>She popped a cough drop in her mouth</b>

11:20.320 --> 11:22.780
<b>and ended up choking on it...</b>

11:22.780 --> 11:23.570
<b>I get it!</b>

11:24.200 --> 11:26.370
<b>So we have to figure out how to prevent disasters</b>

11:26.370 --> 11:28.450
<b>without the help of predictions.</b>

11:28.450 --> 11:30.830
<b>That's the focus of this meeting.</b>

11:30.830 --> 11:34.790
<b>No. Shibabawa-sama has only been able to predict</b>

11:34.790 --> 11:36.590
<b>a handful of disasters.</b>

11:36.880 --> 11:38.460
<b>Excuse me!</b>

11:38.460 --> 11:39.840
<b>Hey, you there.</b>

11:41.130 --> 11:44.090
<b>Who's this Shibabawa-sama? A hero?</b>

11:44.090 --> 11:45.470
<b>You don't know?</b>

11:45.890 --> 11:48.140
<b>She was a seer. A great one at that.</b>

11:48.140 --> 11:51.480
<b>She correctly predicted earthquakes and monster attacks.</b>

11:51.890 --> 11:56.480
<b>We've gotten through many crises 
without Shibabawa-sama's predictions.</b>

11:56.480 --> 11:58.780
<b>But even so, we provided a bodyguard</b>

11:58.780 --> 12:00.820
<b>and gave her special treatment.</b>

12:00.820 --> 12:06.030
<b>Yes, because her few predictions were 100% accurate.</b>

12:06.030 --> 12:07.990
<b>The crux of the problem, though,</b>

12:07.990 --> 12:12.000
<b>is her last, greatest prophecy.</b>

12:12.000 --> 12:15.000
<b>Even as she choked on that final cough drop,</b>

12:15.000 --> 12:17.040
<b>she managed to leave this note.</b>

12:17.880 --> 12:21.550
<b>It is a prophecy that will absolutely come to pass.</b>

12:21.550 --> 12:22.630
<b>Here it is!</b>

12:22.630 --> 12:22.680

<b>I know you are a prodigy, Child Emperor,</b>

<b>but if you cannot grasp the danger,

12:43.990 --> 12:45.360
<b>What'd you say?!</b>

12:45.570 --> 12:47.990
<b>Listen closely!</b>

12:47.990 --> 12:51.500
<b>Shibabawa-sama's predictions are 100% accurate!</b>

12:51.500 --> 12:55.830
<b>She has predicted many catastrophes in the past.</b>

12:55.830 --> 13:00.630
<b>A few of them resulted in the loss of countless lives.</b>

13:00.630 --> 13:06.390
<b>But not once did Shibabawa-sama use the word "trouble".</b>

13:06.390 --> 13:10.970
<b>Something more dangerous than a Dragon- level catastrophe or monster is on its way.</b>

13:10.970 --> 13:13.020

<b>...in the next six months!</b>

<b>Okay, but we've no idea <i>when</i> in the next six months.</b>

13:26.110 --> 13:28.070
<b>You are correct.</b>

<b>But I want you all to be ready for a fight in the next six months!</b>

<b>In the next six months means...</b>

<b>it could be tomorrow, or even today.</b>

<b>This is the Hero Association HQ!</b>

<b>A formidable fortress, to be sure!</b>

14:06.530 --> 14:07.910
<b>Time to attack.</b>

<b>Hawk, Eagle, Falcon, Kite!</b>

<b>Yar!</b>

<b>Wipe out these so-called heroes and the land will belong to us!</b>

<b>Father... above us...</b>

14:24.670 --> 14:25.960
<b>Escape...</b>

14:27.590 --> 14:31.930

<b>Who could have—</b>

14:36.100 --> 14:37.100
<b>What was that?</b>

14:37.100 --> 14:37.810
<b>Who knows?</b>

14:37.810 --> 14:39.690
<b>It flew, so we killed it.</b>

14:39.690 --> 14:41.060
<b>That is good.</b>

14:41.060 --> 14:43.570
<b>Duty, to protect ship.</b>

15:07.210 --> 15:09.880
<b><i>Emergency power activated.</i></b>

15:10.340 --> 15:11.430
<b>What was that?</b>

15:11.840 --> 15:13.680
<b>What's going on out there?</b>

15:14.010 --> 15:15.010
<b>I don't know.</b>

15:15.010 --> 15:17.560
<b>All communications have been cut off!</b>

15:17.810 --> 15:18.850
<b>Damn it...</b>

15:21.810 --> 15:23.270
<b>Impossible!</b>

15:29.490 --> 15:30.860
<b>Dad!</b>

15:30.860 --> 15:33.370
<b>You're okay now. Grab on to me!</b>

15:33.370 --> 15:35.030
<b>That's the way.</b>

15:35.030 --> 15:36.660
<b>Good job.</b>

15:49.840 --> 15:51.130
<b>What is this?</b>

15:53.680 --> 15:56.010
<b>There are survivors?</b>

15:56.010 --> 15:58.100
<b>Ship, failed to kill all.</b>

15:58.100 --> 15:58.970
<b>Then we kill.</b>

15:58.970 --> 16:00.390
<b>That is good.</b>

16:04.310 --> 16:05.770
<b>Get away now!</b>

16:14.990 --> 16:18.040
<b>You think I don't sense your thirst for blood?</b>

16:18.040 --> 16:20.120
<b>I accompanied Master Atomic</b>

16:20.120 --> 16:23.080
<b>and was waiting for the Class S meeting to end,</b>

16:23.080 --> 16:25.580
<b>only to meet thunder and destruction.</b>

16:25.580 --> 16:27.880
<b>Was this your doing?!</b>

16:28.920 --> 16:32.340
<b>D-Destruction levels at 99.8%?!</b>

16:32.340 --> 16:36.350
<b>A-City has been destroyed in an instant!</b>

16:36.680 --> 16:40.850
<b>Who could have known her prediction would come true this soon?!</b>

16:40.850 --> 16:43.600
<b>Hey! Why was this building spared?</b>

16:43.940 --> 16:46.940
<b>We assigned Metal Knight to construct this building.</b>

16:46.940 --> 16:49.860
<b>That's why it's stronger than the average shelter.</b>

16:50.230 --> 16:52.360
<b>So that's why there're no windows.</b>

16:52.740 --> 16:57.410
<b>We should go outside to verify if it's the prophecy.</b>

16:57.780 --> 16:59.540
<b>Sensei! Will you—</b>

17:02.790 --> 17:04.000
<b>Sensei...</b>

17:06.460 --> 17:09.380
<b>That's big! Are they aliens?</b>

17:20.640 --> 17:23.230
<b>So that's what blew the city to pieces.</b>

17:28.190 --> 17:29.570
<b>Go back to...</b>

17:29.820 --> 17:30.570
<b>your planet!</b>

17:37.030 --> 17:39.200
<b>A militant creature.</b>

17:39.200 --> 17:41.080
<b>Also cautious.</b>

17:41.080 --> 17:43.330
<b>Hurry. Let us hurry and kill.</b>

17:43.330 --> 17:44.290
<b>That is good.</b>

17:44.750 --> 17:46.830
<b><i>Is this thing immortal?</i></b>

17:52.630 --> 17:55.130
<b><i>Each of its strikes is lethal!</i></b>

17:55.130 --> 17:56.970
<b><i>I can't beat this thing...</i></b>

17:56.970 --> 17:59.680
<b>Such a weak species.</b>

17:59.680 --> 18:01.350
<b>Easily killed.</b>

18:01.350 --> 18:02.680
<b>That is good.</b>

18:02.680 --> 18:03.930
<b><i>It's splitting?</i></b>

18:03.930 --> 18:06.440
<b><i>Damn, not now...</i></b>

18:06.440 --> 18:09.810
<b>I will dispose of this. You handle the rest.</b>

18:09.810 --> 18:10.690
<b>Very well.</b>

18:10.690 --> 18:13.780
<b>I will go kill those that ran.</b>

18:13.780 --> 18:15.030
<b>That is good.</b>

18:15.030 --> 18:15.490
<b>I—</b>

18:18.990 --> 18:20.030
<b>Master!</b>

18:20.740 --> 18:22.910
<b>Iai, you okay?</b>

18:23.450 --> 18:25.410
<b>You know, your left arm...</b>

18:25.410 --> 18:28.790
<b>Master! Swords have no effect on this monster!</b>

18:28.790 --> 18:30.540
<b>Forget me! Retreat!</b>

18:32.750 --> 18:34.170
<b>Outta my way!</b>

18:38.760 --> 18:42.300
<b>Iai! The path of the sword does not end for you yet!</b>

18:42.300 --> 18:43.350
<b>Stem the bleeding!</b>

18:44.140 --> 18:45.100
<b>Yes, Master!</b>

18:54.320 --> 18:57.740
<b>So there <i>is</i> a life-form on this planet that can fight.</b>

18:58.030 --> 18:58.990
<b>Excellent!</b>

18:58.990 --> 19:01.740
<b>Try to withstand our invasion!</b>

19:02.240 --> 19:05.990
<b>Planet, eh? You from outer space?</b>

19:06.290 --> 19:09.330
<b>And you got friends up in that floaty toy?</b>

19:10.000 --> 19:11.000
<b>Yeah, that's it.</b>

19:11.500 --> 19:16.710
<b>I doubt you alone have the 
power to do all this to the city.</b>

19:16.710 --> 19:19.340
<b>Atomic Samurai, count us in.</b>

19:19.340 --> 19:21.760
<b>You the bastard that smashed this town?!</b>

19:22.590 --> 19:24.470
<b>And if I am?</b>

19:24.470 --> 19:26.520
<b>For all the beautiful men you killed...</b>

19:27.180 --> 19:29.850
<b>I claim vengeance!</b>

19:31.100 --> 19:35.480
<b><i>Each separate attack must be delivered with intent...</i></b>

19:35.480 --> 19:36.190
<b><i>...to kill!</i></b>

19:36.530 --> 19:38.440
<b>Dark Angel</b>

19:38.440 --> 19:39.950
<b>Flash!</b>

19:45.620 --> 19:48.750
<b>Issue an evacuation warning to 
A-City and all neighboring cities!</b>

19:48.750 --> 19:49.370
<b>Right now!</b>

19:50.580 --> 19:54.580
<b>And expand the System M vitals monitor to cover all of A-City.</b>

19:54.580 --> 19:57.250
<b>We need an accurate count of the survivors.</b>

19:57.250 --> 19:58.510
<b>What's the threat level?</b>

19:58.510 --> 20:00.170
<b>"Dragon", without doubt.</b>

20:02.050 --> 20:03.510
<b>No...</b>

20:04.550 --> 20:06.260
<b>This might be "God".</b>

20:08.350 --> 20:12.270
<b>Four Class S heroes can take care of the enemy on the ground...</b>

20:12.270 --> 20:13.850
<b>The problem is <i>that</i>.</b>

20:13.850 --> 20:15.730
<b>We can't reach it.</b>

20:15.730 --> 20:19.280
<b>Any aircraft would be shot down in seconds.</b>

20:19.280 --> 20:23.110
<b>King-san. you're one of the top fighters in Class S.</b>

20:23.110 --> 20:24.360
<b>Give us your take.</b>

20:24.870 --> 20:26.990
<b><i>King, Class S rank 7.</i></b>

20:26.990 --> 20:29.870
<b><i>Said to be the strongest man on Earth,</i></b>

20:29.870 --> 20:32.960
<b><i>and I see he is well respected by the other heroes...</i></b>

20:34.750 --> 20:36.380
<b>There's nothing I can do.</b>

20:37.590 --> 20:41.380
<b>It's too high in the sky. 
There's no way to attack it.</b>

20:42.300 --> 20:45.510
<b>But the mysterious craft is currently dormant.</b>

20:45.510 --> 20:48.140
<b>We should use this opportunity to call in Metal Knight.</b>

20:48.140 --> 20:50.770
<b>What the—?! That's pathetic!</b>

20:50.770 --> 20:52.730
<b>Aren't you supposed to be the strongest man?</b>

20:52.730 --> 20:54.270
<b>Wait, Tatsumaki-chan.</b>

20:54.270 --> 20:56.770
<b>This city's been blown away,</b>

20:54.270 --> 20:56.770
<b>If you piss King off, he'll kill you.</b>

20:56.770 --> 20:58.940
<b>And you're just going to give them a free hand?</b>

20:58.940 --> 20:59.650
<b>Unbelievable!</b>

21:02.650 --> 21:05.570
<b>Well forget it! I'll take care of this myself!</b>

21:05.570 --> 21:07.410
<b>Wait, I will go too.</b>

21:08.240 --> 21:10.540
<b>I do not know how effective I can be,</b>

21:10.540 --> 21:12.540
<b>but I will attack from the ground.</b>

21:14.040 --> 21:15.250
<b>Maybe you didn't hear me.</b>

21:15.250 --> 21:16.790
<b>I said forget about it!</b>

21:18.170 --> 21:20.050
<b>Take it easy, Genos-kun.</b>

21:20.050 --> 21:23.260
<b>I understand how you feel, 
but if you piss her off, she'll kill you.</b>

21:23.760 --> 21:25.180
<b><i>Very well...</i></b>

21:25.180 --> 21:28.260
<b><i>There is no need to team up anyway.</i></b>

21:28.260 --> 21:32.060
<b><i>Sensei has already boarded the enemy ship.</i></b>

21:32.060 --> 21:34.350
<b><i>Whether this is the prophecy or not,</i></b>

21:34.350 --> 21:37.230
<b><i>there's not a single evil being 
that Sensei cannot defeat.</i></b>

21:37.230 --> 21:40.610
<b><i>If such an evil existed,</i></b>

21:40.610 --> 21:43.860
<b><i>then I think the human race would have perished long ago.</i></b>

21:48.660 --> 21:51.330
<b>Well done making it this far, intruder!</b>

21:51.330 --> 21:52.620
<b>But this is the end.</b>

21:53.200 --> 21:57.250
<b>You see, there is no way you can defeat me, Groribas!</b>

21:57.370 --> 22:00.880
<b>My Acid Breath will melt you away!</b>

22:14.850 --> 22:17.980
<b>Isn't it about time for the boss to show up?</b>
