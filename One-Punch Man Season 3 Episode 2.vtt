01:45.104 --> 01:48.358
As you can see from the pitiful state
of the Hero Association,

01:48.441 --> 01:50.110
humanity has no chance of winning.

01:50.193 --> 01:51.027
OBEY THE MONSTERS

01:51.111 --> 01:53.154
We must surrender completely.

01:53.238 --> 01:55.698
If we resist, it's certain
we'll all be slaughtered.

01:55.782 --> 01:57.992
COOPERATE WITH THE MONSTERS
HUMANITY CANNOT WIN

01:58.076 --> 02:00.537
And therefore,
the Monster Worship Party has come up

02:00.620 --> 02:02.455
with the only possible solution.

02:02.539 --> 02:03.581
MONSTER WORSHIP

02:03.665 --> 02:07.085
By offering human sacrifices
regularly to the monsters

02:07.168 --> 02:09.712
and controlling their rate of consumption,

02:09.796 --> 02:12.465
we can avoid the complete extinction
of our species.

02:13.299 --> 02:17.971
Those of you who want to side
with the monsters, come with us!

02:18.638 --> 02:21.558
We must survive in a world where
common sense and moral values

02:21.641 --> 02:22.934
are being rewritten!

02:23.017 --> 02:24.644
Shut up!

02:24.727 --> 02:28.148
I'd rather die
than side with the monsters!

02:28.231 --> 02:29.190
MONSTER

02:29.274 --> 02:33.987
Very well! You can be the first sacrifice!

02:34.070 --> 02:35.488
Get him!

02:36.781 --> 02:38.658
Hey, wait up!

02:43.788 --> 02:47.417
Offering up sacrifices
just to save yourselves...

02:47.500 --> 02:50.295
You're underestimating monsters
way too much, you bastards.

02:50.378 --> 02:55.550
I'm disappointed at how easily
human society can be shaken.

02:56.175 --> 03:00.179
<i>If things are already like this,
I'm worried that</i>

03:00.263 --> 03:03.725
<i>when I make my dramatic entrance
as the most powerful monster,</i>

03:03.808 --> 03:05.518
<i>it won't make much of an impact.</i>

03:05.602 --> 03:06.436
MONSTER TRAITS

03:06.519 --> 03:08.813
<i>Some citizens have turned
into a mob everywhere,</i>

03:08.897 --> 03:11.399
<i>committing robberies, burglaries,
and bag-snatchings.</i>

03:11.482 --> 03:13.860
<i>Police and heroes
are working side-by-side,</i>

03:13.943 --> 03:16.154
<i>patrolling the streets and urging caution.</i>

03:16.237 --> 03:18.156
<i>In City S, another group has appeared</i>

03:18.239 --> 03:21.159
<i>proclaiming that the end
of human history has come,</i>

03:21.242 --> 03:25.038
<i>spreading confusion
as they march through the streets.</i>

03:25.121 --> 03:27.624
<i>Just because monsters are on a rampage,</i>

03:27.707 --> 03:30.376
<i>it doesn't mean
your own crimes are excused.</i>

03:31.210 --> 03:34.130
<i>The Monster Association
half-asses everything</i>

03:34.213 --> 03:36.925
<i>and that's why those loudmouthed punks
get more brazen...</i>

03:37.842 --> 03:38.927
What do you want?

03:39.010 --> 03:40.845
You bumped into me, old man.

03:40.929 --> 03:43.181
Got any complaints?

03:43.765 --> 03:46.226
Shut up! He bumped into me!

03:46.309 --> 03:48.269
He's drunk and out of control.

03:48.353 --> 03:51.689
The monsters are gonna kill us all anyway.

03:51.773 --> 03:53.358
Why the hell should I hold back?

03:53.775 --> 03:54.901
Hey.

03:54.984 --> 03:57.570
You're blocking the entrance. Beat it.

03:58.905 --> 04:01.699
You say somethin'? You punk!

04:08.373 --> 04:09.582
I said, beat it.

04:10.792 --> 04:12.794
<i>I'm not like them.</i>

04:13.419 --> 04:17.131
<i>I can unleash true terror
that will silence even these scumbags.</i>

04:18.424 --> 04:21.261
<i>But right now, I'm too hungry.</i>

04:22.345 --> 04:24.555
Here is your extra-thick steak
mega-eater set

04:24.639 --> 04:26.683
with a super-sized portion of rice.

04:27.308 --> 04:28.559
Please enjoy.

04:29.852 --> 04:31.688
It's a meal fit for a mammoth!

04:48.830 --> 04:51.541
This isn't nearly enough.

04:53.293 --> 04:56.212
Give me everything on this meat menu
from top to bottom.

04:56.838 --> 04:59.048
I'll also take
every kind of salad you have.

04:59.132 --> 05:01.134
Oh, yeah, and also give me a ton of water.

05:06.681 --> 05:08.516
I'd like to order more.

05:08.599 --> 05:10.601
CRUNCH CRUNCH
NOM NOM

05:10.685 --> 05:12.520
CHOMP CHOMP
MUNCH MUNCH

05:12.603 --> 05:14.480
CRUNCH CRUNCH
CHOMP CHOMP

05:14.564 --> 05:17.442
CHOMP CHOMP
MUNCH MUNCH

05:21.404 --> 05:23.781
GULP GULP

05:23.865 --> 05:25.491
SLAM

05:31.122 --> 05:33.791
I'm stuffed.
That was a meal fit for a baboon!

05:34.375 --> 05:35.543
Now then...

05:40.006 --> 05:41.340
<i>My wallet's gone!</i>

05:42.842 --> 05:46.012
<i>Did I drop it back at the supermarket
when I bought napa cabbage?</i>

05:46.554 --> 05:48.181
<i>Oh... crap.</i>

05:48.931 --> 05:51.934
<i>I could call Genos,
but he's broken right now.</i>

05:54.896 --> 05:58.107
<i>This month's lunch special
is fried deep-sea fish.</i>

05:58.191 --> 06:00.485
<i>Although public safety is a concern,</i>

06:00.568 --> 06:03.946
<i>our restaurant maintains
strict security measures</i>

06:04.030 --> 06:06.616
<i>against robbery, violence,
and dine-and-dash incidents.</i>

06:08.534 --> 06:12.288
<i>A former pro hero is also stationed
in our security office.</i>

06:12.371 --> 06:16.125
<i>So you can dine without worry.</i>

06:16.209 --> 06:19.462
<i>Damn... After this announcement,
if I tell a waiter about my situation,</i>

06:19.545 --> 06:21.881
<i>it'll look like I got scared
and turned myself in.</i>

06:22.840 --> 06:24.759
<i>Oh, crap, what a mess.</i>

06:25.176 --> 06:28.721
<i>This is the biggest crisis
I've faced all year.</i>

06:29.555 --> 06:30.431
Hey, you!

06:30.515 --> 06:32.058
<i>This could be the end for me.</i>

06:32.141 --> 06:33.518
I'm talking to you!

06:33.601 --> 06:34.811
Saitama!

06:35.311 --> 06:37.438
No, it's not what it looks like!
I was just...

06:37.522 --> 06:38.856
What are you talking about?

06:40.233 --> 06:41.692
What're you doing here?

06:41.776 --> 06:44.946
Jeez, I looked all over for you, Saitama!

06:45.029 --> 06:47.824
You left in the middle
of our conversation!

06:47.907 --> 06:51.077
So, you're looking for
the Hero Hunter, right?

06:51.577 --> 06:54.956
Fine then. I'll help you out.

06:55.039 --> 06:56.916
Excuse me, I'd like to add to my order.

06:56.999 --> 06:59.210
- In return, I'm taking...
- One extra large fries.

06:59.293 --> 07:01.045
...70% of the points as a success fee.

07:01.629 --> 07:05.299
You've quickly risen to Class B, Rank 7.

07:05.383 --> 07:07.802
But it'll be hard
to climb higher from there.

07:08.511 --> 07:14.142
If this goes well, reaching top five
of Class B is definitely possible.

07:14.225 --> 07:18.438
But for that, you'll need my cooperation.

07:18.896 --> 07:21.357
You probably don't even know anything

07:21.441 --> 07:24.068
about your target
or their facial features, right?

07:24.152 --> 07:28.448
Honestly, you're hopeless.
I'll provide you with the intel.

07:28.531 --> 07:31.826
From now on, you will follow
my instructions and act accordingly...

07:31.909 --> 07:32.743
DAZE

07:32.827 --> 07:33.953
You listening?

07:34.036 --> 07:36.456
Your fries, sir. Please enjoy.

07:42.253 --> 07:43.379
You're sharing with me?

07:45.673 --> 07:46.591
Thanks.

07:52.263 --> 07:54.515
<i>What's with that grin?</i>

07:55.141 --> 07:58.352
<i>He must be thrilled to be working with me.</i>

07:58.436 --> 08:01.397
<i>Maybe Saitama will now join
the Blizzard Bunch.</i>

08:01.481 --> 08:03.107
A dine-and-dasher!

08:03.191 --> 08:05.067
But I haven't done it yet!

08:05.151 --> 08:07.612
Someone catch that guy!

08:09.989 --> 08:11.407
Dine-and-dashing is terrible.

08:11.491 --> 08:13.117
- I'll go after him.
- Hey... Saitama?

08:13.201 --> 08:16.078
You ate a fry, right? The bill's on you!

08:19.123 --> 08:21.626
<i>One... fry?</i>

08:21.709 --> 08:23.878
<i>Are you kidding me?</i>

08:23.961 --> 08:26.172
<i>The world's falling apart</i>

08:26.255 --> 08:28.508
<i>and he's being this petty?</i>

08:31.219 --> 08:33.846
<i>Guess a marathon was still
a bit too much for me.</i>

08:35.056 --> 08:37.266
It would be better to heal your wounds

08:37.350 --> 08:39.769
under the protection
of the Monster Association.

08:39.852 --> 08:44.690
But, first, you'll need
to fulfill a condition.

08:44.774 --> 08:47.735
<i>"Bring back a hero's head"?</i>

08:48.402 --> 08:51.030
<i>So if you kill a hero,
you're considered a monster?</i>

08:51.113 --> 08:52.907
<i>What kind of logic is that?</i>

08:52.990 --> 08:58.120
<i>Monsters should be able to incite
absolute fear with their mere presence.</i>

08:59.956 --> 09:02.166
<i>Oh, man, my head hurts...</i>

09:07.838 --> 09:09.090
<i>Who cares.</i>

09:12.468 --> 09:16.347
Hey, Tareo, how did you get out alive?

09:16.430 --> 09:18.474
Maybe you're a monster, too!

09:18.558 --> 09:20.643
Yeah, an ugly monster!

09:20.726 --> 09:22.853
That hurts!

09:26.357 --> 09:27.567
Knock it off!

09:28.317 --> 09:30.528
Mommy!

09:32.113 --> 09:34.282
Look at that ugly cry-face.

09:34.782 --> 09:37.535
No wonder they bully you. Poor kid.

09:38.828 --> 09:42.206
Hey, what are the odds
we meet twice on the same day.

09:42.290 --> 09:43.124
Old dude?

09:43.207 --> 09:45.459
Don't call me, old. I'm only 18!

09:48.087 --> 09:50.673
Hurry up and go home.
The sun's going down.

09:50.756 --> 09:52.967
Monsters might come out again.

09:55.386 --> 09:56.554
Old dude...

09:58.055 --> 09:59.348
Sorry...

10:00.266 --> 10:02.310
For running away earlier today.

10:06.397 --> 10:09.317
<i>I saw everything...</i>

10:10.276 --> 10:16.073
<i>The heroes were trying to kill you,
but that was a mistake, right?</i>

10:16.157 --> 10:21.829
After all, you protected me
from the bullets that time!

10:21.912 --> 10:25.082
And just now. You saved me again.

10:25.625 --> 10:28.169
I bet you're a champion of justice and--

10:29.337 --> 10:32.298
Cut it out. You're giving me goosebumps.

10:32.381 --> 10:33.966
Hey, dine-and-dasher!

10:35.301 --> 10:36.636
Hey, dine-and-dasher!

10:37.261 --> 10:39.472
You scumbag!
How dare you leave without paying!

10:39.555 --> 10:40.473
Is that a hero?

10:40.556 --> 10:44.185
Your timing was perfect, you scumbag!
So, I'll let it slide this time!

10:44.268 --> 10:45.603
Wait, what do you mean?

10:45.686 --> 10:47.438
Okay, so let this be your warning.

10:47.521 --> 10:50.066
Didn't you come to fight me?

10:50.149 --> 10:52.985
Are you scared now? What's your hero name?

10:58.324 --> 11:00.910
Cape... Caped Baldy.

11:00.993 --> 11:04.997
<i>I didn't catch that.
But he does look like a hero.</i>

11:05.623 --> 11:08.084
<i>He may be a small fry,
but I'll hunt any hero.</i>

11:09.001 --> 11:12.671
He's not even in the Hero Almanac,
so I bet he's new.

11:12.755 --> 11:14.215
Go home, kid.

11:16.008 --> 11:18.594
Old dude... Did you dine-and-dash?

11:19.095 --> 11:21.889
He said he'll let it go,
so don't hassle him.

11:25.601 --> 11:27.061
<i>What a joke.</i>

11:28.145 --> 11:30.106
<i>Let alone the Monster Association,</i>

11:30.189 --> 11:33.317
<i>if I start getting pity even from
small-time heroes and brats,</i>

11:33.401 --> 11:35.027
<i>then I'm really done for.</i>

11:35.736 --> 11:38.614
<i>When I heard that
the old geezer survived, I felt relieved.</i>

11:38.697 --> 11:41.158
<i>It makes me sick to think
that I felt that way.</i>

11:41.867 --> 11:43.828
<i>Whatever the definition of a monster is,</i>

11:43.911 --> 11:47.248
<i>it's clear I don't have
the resolve to be one.</i>

11:47.331 --> 11:49.125
<i>I'll do it.</i>

11:49.708 --> 11:52.420
<i>If a hero's head is what you want,
I'll get you one.</i>

11:52.503 --> 11:56.173
<i>Don't underestimate me... I'm a monster.</i>

11:58.259 --> 12:01.429
Hey, you're mine!

12:02.388 --> 12:05.641
Sorry, I'm just as guilty as you,
so I can't be seen with you.

12:11.355 --> 12:12.481
Oops...

12:13.691 --> 12:14.733
I screwed up.

12:15.734 --> 12:18.154
I didn't mean to knock him out.

12:19.113 --> 12:21.574
<i>Oh, great, a witness.</i>

12:21.657 --> 12:22.783
<i>What's that book?</i>

12:23.200 --> 12:25.703
<i>Of all people,
it had to be some hero-obsessed kid.</i>

12:26.620 --> 12:28.914
<i>Guess my cover's blown.</i>

12:28.998 --> 12:30.040
<i>Damn it.</i>

12:31.208 --> 12:33.419
Hey, kid, do you know who I am?

12:36.755 --> 12:37.715
HERO ALMANAC

12:37.798 --> 12:39.175
Let me take a look at that.

12:41.594 --> 12:42.511
Are you serious?

12:43.137 --> 12:44.597
I'm not even listed in here.

12:45.306 --> 12:46.307
Figures...

12:49.560 --> 12:50.728
Who was that?

12:52.021 --> 12:53.439
I almost forgot!

12:53.522 --> 12:54.732
Old dude!

12:54.815 --> 12:56.484
Wake up, old dude!

12:57.902 --> 12:59.320
<i>One-Punch Man!</i>

13:02.990 --> 13:04.408
<i>One-Punch Man!</i>

13:19.423 --> 13:21.133
You okay, old dude?

13:21.634 --> 13:25.554
That bald hero guy said, "I screwed up"
and ran away.

13:26.472 --> 13:27.806
I lost?

13:27.890 --> 13:29.934
What kind of hero was he?

13:30.017 --> 13:31.810
You don't remember?

13:31.894 --> 13:34.104
Maybe he hit your head in a bad spot.

13:35.272 --> 13:39.068
Garou, what's going on?

13:43.197 --> 13:45.115
We've been watching you the whole time.

13:46.242 --> 13:50.079
You're not like us, Garou.

13:50.162 --> 13:52.373
Yeah, that's right.

13:52.456 --> 13:53.916
It's a shame, but...

13:53.999 --> 13:57.711
You lack the qualities of a true monster.

13:59.713 --> 14:00.923
Hey, kid...

14:01.507 --> 14:03.676
Stop staring and go home.

14:04.385 --> 14:06.929
These guys wanna have a word with me.

14:16.438 --> 14:18.023
He's in my almanac.

14:18.524 --> 14:20.776
It wasn't just hearsay.

14:22.486 --> 14:24.280
What is he doing... here?

14:24.363 --> 14:25.823
URBAN LEGEND MONSTER

14:27.032 --> 14:28.367
That's King the Ripper.

14:28.868 --> 14:31.245
He's abducted many kids.

14:32.329 --> 14:34.498
It's King the Ripper!

14:35.749 --> 14:37.626
Hey! Pull yourself together!

14:37.710 --> 14:39.211
Stop crying and get up!

14:39.295 --> 14:43.924
Who knew you had such
a small friend, Garou.

14:44.008 --> 14:46.427
Hey, stop! Talk from over there!

14:46.510 --> 14:49.513
Oh, my... Sorry.

14:49.597 --> 14:53.100
I didn't mean to make you cry yet.

14:53.183 --> 14:54.393
My bad.

14:55.060 --> 15:00.190
I was planning to savor
those screams later.

15:00.274 --> 15:01.734
Sorry about that.

15:02.276 --> 15:04.069
You poor thing.

15:04.153 --> 15:07.531
I'll make sure to chop up
every last inch of your body to pieces.

15:07.615 --> 15:09.366
Forgive me.

15:10.993 --> 15:12.494
Little boy...

15:12.578 --> 15:15.456
You're doomed. Sorry.

15:17.249 --> 15:18.375
Stay back.

15:22.796 --> 15:23.714
Pardon me.

15:23.797 --> 15:25.382
I'd like to ask a question.

15:25.466 --> 15:28.928
I hate to be interrupted
when I'm meditating. What is it?

15:29.011 --> 15:32.056
Why did you send King the Ripper
and Insect God?

15:32.139 --> 15:33.641
If it was just for observation,

15:33.724 --> 15:35.893
you didn't need to send those two brutes.

15:35.976 --> 15:38.771
Why not? They may actually
get along surprisingly well.

15:38.854 --> 15:39.855
Don't be ridiculous.

15:39.939 --> 15:42.775
Those two never follow orders.

15:42.858 --> 15:45.194
They'll probably get carried away
and kill Garou.

15:45.277 --> 15:49.573
Especially King the Ripper.
He's a rare breed that kills for pleasure.

15:49.657 --> 15:53.160
Even the other monsters won't go near him.

15:53.243 --> 15:57.164
Exactly, that was my point.
I let them make contact with Garou

15:57.247 --> 16:00.167
so that it would stimulate him
and promote his growth.

16:00.250 --> 16:01.126
Growth?

16:01.210 --> 16:04.797
This is a trial for that indecisive boy.

16:04.880 --> 16:08.300
First, we need to
tear apart his body and his mind

16:08.384 --> 16:09.843
until they are in tatters...

16:09.927 --> 16:12.721
I look forward to seeing how he changes

16:12.805 --> 16:15.182
after experiencing monsters firsthand.

16:15.265 --> 16:18.519
Gyoro-Gyoro, what are you after?

16:18.602 --> 16:21.063
What do you really
intend to do with Garou?

16:21.146 --> 16:22.690
Why are you asking?

16:22.773 --> 16:24.858
No reason. Just curious.

16:24.942 --> 16:26.819
Listen, Phoenix Man.

16:26.902 --> 16:29.905
Where do you think Lord Orochi came from?

16:29.989 --> 16:31.281
I don't know...

16:31.365 --> 16:33.367
Isn't he an ancient creature or something?

16:34.535 --> 16:38.247
Lord Orochi was once human like Garou.

16:39.498 --> 16:44.128
After countless failures and sacrifices,
he finally became the ultimate lifeform.

16:44.211 --> 16:47.339
He is truly worthy
of the name, Monster King.

16:47.423 --> 16:50.175
It was I who created Lord Orochi.

16:50.259 --> 16:52.511
Created? You did?

16:52.594 --> 16:57.057
If Garou is trained properly,
he might become a second Lord Orochi.

16:57.141 --> 16:59.351
Only I know the secret to do that.

16:59.435 --> 17:02.354
I've instructed Insect God to intervene

17:02.438 --> 17:05.274
if King the Ripper goes too far
with Garou.

17:05.357 --> 17:08.068
But if he dies,
then that's just how it goes.

17:08.152 --> 17:11.822
We'll just wait for
the next suitable specimen to show up.

17:15.826 --> 17:18.996
I scoped out the area
and sealed the back entrance.

17:19.079 --> 17:22.082
For the last few hours,
no one has come or gone but the gorilla.

17:22.541 --> 17:24.752
The other members are all out.

17:24.835 --> 17:26.336
This is the perfect time.

17:26.420 --> 17:29.673
The command center is probably inside.
Perhaps in the monitor room.

17:30.549 --> 17:34.136
A strange group of unidentified people
recently moved in.

17:34.219 --> 17:36.638
They've been bringing in
large amounts of equipment

17:36.722 --> 17:37.931
and mysterious powders...

17:38.432 --> 17:41.185
And boxes filled with putrid matter.

17:41.268 --> 17:45.647
The information I've gathered
matches my suspicions.

17:46.315 --> 17:48.484
No doubt about it. It must be them.

17:49.068 --> 17:51.612
Now's the time. I'm going in.

17:53.280 --> 17:58.202
Gyoro-Gyoro ordered us
to observe your actions.

17:58.285 --> 18:02.706
To determine if you're truly worthy
of joining our ranks.

18:14.176 --> 18:16.053
Hero Hunter...

18:16.136 --> 18:21.850
Are you just some freak who gets off
on pretending to be a monster?

18:21.934 --> 18:23.811
Or are you a true monster?

18:24.812 --> 18:26.772
Look at you, talking all high and mighty.

18:26.855 --> 18:30.192
I was just getting sick of
how soft you guys are.

18:30.275 --> 18:32.694
Fine then. Kill that boy.

18:32.778 --> 18:35.447
What do you mean?

18:35.531 --> 18:39.493
A monster is one who has
abandoned being human.

18:39.576 --> 18:42.079
A being severed from the world of humans.

18:42.162 --> 18:45.833
I saw you help that boy.

18:45.916 --> 18:48.168
That is unacceptable. You must kill him.

18:48.794 --> 18:51.130
In order to join the Monster Association,

18:51.213 --> 18:54.675
you must work hard to gain our trust.

18:54.758 --> 18:57.803
But you haven't fully let go
of being human.

18:57.886 --> 19:01.223
We don't need any half-hearted types.

19:01.306 --> 19:05.102
We're building an organization that will
destroy human society and take control.

19:05.185 --> 19:07.020
We kill kids off like they're nothing.

19:07.104 --> 19:10.315
And just now, you even lost
to that mediocre hero.

19:10.399 --> 19:13.777
Even if you were caught off-guard,
I doubt you'll be useful in combat.

19:14.444 --> 19:18.532
Hey, I already told you.
Hurry up and go home, kid.

19:19.825 --> 19:22.286
My legs are shaking... I can't move.

19:23.078 --> 19:24.705
I can't move!

19:24.788 --> 19:25.831
You idiot!

19:25.914 --> 19:29.751
Don't think someone will help you
because you can't stand up.

19:29.835 --> 19:31.503
No one's gonna help you.

19:31.587 --> 19:33.755
You have to protect yourself.

19:33.839 --> 19:37.259
In moments like this,
the only choice is to become stronger!

19:39.136 --> 19:40.679
You need to get strong.

19:41.805 --> 19:44.016
Stand up! Tareo!

20:23.513 --> 20:24.723
Run!!

20:25.974 --> 20:27.601
It's too late.

20:27.684 --> 20:30.687
You're our enemy now.

20:30.771 --> 20:34.608
You call yourself the Hero Hunter,
yet you haven't killed a single soul.

20:34.691 --> 20:37.194
Just like I thought,
you're a spineless wimp.

20:37.945 --> 20:40.572
I don't like your attitude.

20:44.701 --> 20:45.786
Come on!

22:20.881 --> 22:24.259
<i>At last... I've finally tracked them down.</i>

22:24.843 --> 22:29.431
<i>My archenemies I've hunted for years,
the ones most entwined with my fate.</i>

22:30.140 --> 22:33.518
<i>The worst organization in history
that's plotting to wipe out humanity</i>

22:33.602 --> 22:35.020
<i>and reshape the world.</i>

22:36.313 --> 22:41.401
<i>I had started to suspect
their true identity from recent events.</i>

22:41.485 --> 22:44.279
<i>But I could never get a solid lead.</i>

22:45.530 --> 22:48.742
<i>Shibabawa prophesized
that the Earth is in danger.</i>

22:48.825 --> 22:52.412
<i>They are pulling the strings behind
the so-called Monster Association.</i>

22:53.288 --> 22:55.499
<i>They're the true masterminds
behind it all.</i>

22:56.208 --> 22:57.626
<i>No doubt about it!</i>

23:00.921 --> 23:02.047
HOUSE OF TAKOYAKI

23:02.130 --> 23:04.341
It's over for you!

23:04.424 --> 23:05.550
The House of Evolution!

23:06.843 --> 23:08.261
A customer?

23:08.345 --> 23:09.805
You're a customer, aren't you?

23:10.889 --> 23:14.768
You keep relocating your base and
this time, your front is a takoyaki stand?

23:14.851 --> 23:16.311
What a joke.

23:16.394 --> 23:19.189
I already know your little schemes.

23:19.272 --> 23:20.190
I won't be fooled.

23:20.899 --> 23:22.400
Hold on, okay?

23:22.484 --> 23:24.194
We're still getting ready.

23:25.904 --> 23:28.949
I am now a hero called Zombieman.

23:29.032 --> 23:30.992
The one with a body that can't die.

23:32.119 --> 23:36.289
Maybe Experimental Sample
No. 66 rings a bell?

23:36.373 --> 23:40.043
You're a hero who's come to
take down the House of Evolution?

23:40.127 --> 23:43.547
Sorry, but the House of Evolution
has already been destroyed.

23:47.634 --> 23:51.763
Well... you want to come inside?

23:51.847 --> 23:53.640
I've got some free time now.

23:54.474 --> 23:56.935
TO BE CONTINUED

23:57.018 --> 24:01.982
ORGANISM LIMITS
