=Episode 26=

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:55.190
You want to work?

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:56.910
Yes, it's me.

00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:58.190
So sloppy.

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:59.350
Where did you work before?

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:01.350
I was in Fenglin Town.

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:02.550
Why did you come to Yong'an?

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:04.680
There are more opportunities

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:05.960
in Yong'an.

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:08.070
It's hard to find work
in Fenglin Town now.

00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:09.990
I see.

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:11.480
You couldn't make it in Fenglin, huh?

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:13.240
Let's go.

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:16.200
Where are we heading?

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:17.480
To Juxian Alley.

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:18.430
Wait.

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:19.830
There are so many places.

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:21.300
Why Juxian Alley?

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:22.310
With your qualifications,

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:23.620
it's hard to find work elsewhere.

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:24.900
Recently, the Shen family

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:26.370
has been leading the recruitment.

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:27.600
Everyone's following suit.

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:28.950
There are fewer slave trades now.

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:30.440
You can try to recommend yourself.

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:32.200
Question: Is it the Shen family

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:34.030
who's running Shen's Diner?

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:35.400
- Yes.
- I won't go there.

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:36.710
I can't go there.

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:37.990
How can I?

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:38.870
I won't.

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:40.360
Don't worry.

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:41.640
Shen's Diner isn't hiring.

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:43.150
Many people want to go there.

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:44.200
You won't be chosen.

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:45.680
Another question.

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:47.830
Which other diner has copied

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:50.080
Shen's Diner's recruitment method?

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:51.480
Yunlai Tavern.

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:52.750
Yunlai Tavern?

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:53.760
Right.

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:56.860
(Yunlai Tavern)

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:28.030
Name.

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:28.870
A Dou.

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:29.920
What?

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:31.080
A Dou.

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:32.800
How strange.

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:33.640
A Dou?

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:34.870
What's the surname?

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:38.080
Just "A". Is that okay?

00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:41.550
Why?

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:42.870
Any pimples on your face?

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:50.830
Aside from being dirty,

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:52.400
he's fine.

00:03:57.960 --> 00:03:59.270
Just like in TV shows.

00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:01.680
A fake beard is enough as a disguise.

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:05.480
Today,

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:06.950
we need someone to lead the horse

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:08.310
and show the way for Mr. Lu.

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:10.800
You need to be with him often.

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:12.360
Be quick-witted.

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:13.640
Definitely.

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:16.030
When Mr. Lu makes tea,

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:17.600
you need to watch the water.

00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:19.020
That's being quick-witted.

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:26.040
Hey, let me do it.

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:27.470
I'm good at this; you take a break.

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:30.030
Here, Mr. Lu.

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:32.000
Here.

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:36.620
- Sorry.
- Go.

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:39.280
Give me another chance.

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:40.340
I'm not usually like this.

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:41.310
I was just too nervous.

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:42.800
I'm usually very quick-witted.

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:45.040
Quick-witted?

00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:46.630
Give me another chance.

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:47.990
- Let's talk this over.
- Leave.

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:48.920
With food and lodging,

00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:50.240
I only need 10 qian a month.

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:51.190
We can't give you that.

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:52.040
Mr. Lu.

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:53.280
Eight qian will do.

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:54.260
We can't give you that.

00:04:54.950 --> 00:04:56.310
Five qian, then.

00:04:56.430 --> 00:04:57.310
Just leave.

00:04:57.310 --> 00:04:58.920
I don't care about salary.

00:04:58.920 --> 00:04:59.760
Mr. Lu.

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:00.830
Wait.

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:07.480
Go sign the contract.

00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:09.120
Tidy up your hair and beard.

00:05:09.390 --> 00:05:11.190
Thank you, Mr. Lu.

00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:14.480
But my body and hair
are given by my parents.

00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:15.550
I can't just damage them.

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:16.840
I'll just wash up.

00:05:17.390 --> 00:05:18.280
Rest assured.

00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:19.680
I'll be spotless.

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:20.520
Is that okay?

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:26.510
Come on.

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:28.080
This way.

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:36.640
Mr. Lu,

00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:38.040
this man may be foolish,

00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:40.190
but he'll do for a meal.

00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:42.510
Aside from the Chunyan
that Feng Li bought,

00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:44.430
there's no such bargain anymore.

00:05:44.750 --> 00:05:45.680
Also,

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:47.750
for the Competition next month,

00:05:47.750 --> 00:05:48.590
don't we

00:05:48.750 --> 00:05:50.600
need a new face?

00:06:08.020 --> 00:06:09.860
(Shen's Diner)

00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:11.480
Mr. Shen, you called for me?

00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:12.430
Yu San.

00:06:12.430 --> 00:06:13.600
I've prepared a few dishes.

00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:14.840
Sit and taste them.

00:06:14.870 --> 00:06:15.710
Come on.

00:06:17.190 --> 00:06:18.120
In other places,

00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:19.800
we can only eat
after the diner is closed.

00:06:20.510 --> 00:06:21.720
That's nonsense.

00:06:21.870 --> 00:06:23.240
Once you're in Shen's Diner,

00:06:23.510 --> 00:06:24.610
you're not just an employee;

00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:26.720
you're family.

00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:28.070
Stop wasting time and sit.

00:06:28.070 --> 00:06:29.920
Taste these stir-fries

00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:32.510
and give an honest evaluation.

00:06:33.430 --> 00:06:34.270
Come on.

00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:35.950
Why are you so kind to me?

00:06:37.390 --> 00:06:38.280
That's kind?

00:06:38.510 --> 00:06:40.390
People should treat each other this way.

00:06:40.390 --> 00:06:41.280
It's normal.

00:06:41.430 --> 00:06:43.240
Maybe I need to reshape

00:06:43.240 --> 00:06:44.920
your understanding of relationships.

00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:46.200
Also,

00:06:46.950 --> 00:06:48.360
look at how thin you are.

00:06:49.190 --> 00:06:50.950
You must've suffered a lot in the past.

00:06:52.360 --> 00:06:54.510
No one treats a slave like this.

00:06:55.720 --> 00:06:56.560
What?

00:06:56.840 --> 00:06:58.070
Aren't you a commoner?

00:06:58.240 --> 00:06:59.430
Why a slave now?

00:07:00.190 --> 00:07:01.680
It doesn't matter.

00:07:02.070 --> 00:07:03.360
Even if you are a slave,

00:07:03.360 --> 00:07:04.200
it's okay.

00:07:04.630 --> 00:07:06.240
We'll find a way to redeem you.

00:07:06.480 --> 00:07:07.550
Do you know Deyuan?

00:07:07.920 --> 00:07:09.360
She was deceived

00:07:09.360 --> 00:07:10.990
by Manager Feng from Yunlai Tavern,

00:07:11.240 --> 00:07:12.550
signed a Slave Deed,

00:07:12.550 --> 00:07:13.920
and became a slave.

00:07:14.190 --> 00:07:15.310
But we managed

00:07:15.310 --> 00:07:17.120
to redeem her.

00:07:18.870 --> 00:07:20.190
No, I was just joking.

00:07:21.240 --> 00:07:22.310
Don't joke about that.

00:07:22.310 --> 00:07:23.480
Come on.

00:07:23.480 --> 00:07:24.390
Here.

00:07:24.390 --> 00:07:25.360
Have a try.

00:07:25.360 --> 00:07:26.200
Sure.

00:07:43.310 --> 00:07:44.150
How is it?

00:07:45.950 --> 00:07:46.950
Not bad,

00:07:47.990 --> 00:07:48.840
but

00:07:48.840 --> 00:07:50.280
nothing special either.

00:07:52.390 --> 00:07:53.840
These are stir-fried dishes.

00:07:55.120 --> 00:07:56.240
In our dynasty,

00:07:56.240 --> 00:07:58.510
it's something groundbreaking.

00:07:58.510 --> 00:07:59.870
Before us,

00:07:59.870 --> 00:08:01.510
outsiders had never even seen it.

00:08:01.510 --> 00:08:03.720
A revolutionary way of cooking.

00:08:03.870 --> 00:08:04.710
Mr. Shen,

00:08:05.280 --> 00:08:06.240
I've always thought

00:08:06.240 --> 00:08:07.430
that the dishes you stir-fry

00:08:07.950 --> 00:08:09.160
all taste pretty much the same.

00:08:10.550 --> 00:08:11.880
At first, customers find it novel

00:08:11.880 --> 00:08:12.830
because they've never

00:08:12.830 --> 00:08:13.470
had it before.

00:08:13.600 --> 00:08:14.550
But after a while,

00:08:14.800 --> 00:08:15.950
to put it simply,

00:08:16.190 --> 00:08:17.600
they're just ordinary.

00:08:17.600 --> 00:08:18.440
What?

00:08:18.630 --> 00:08:19.750
If there's nothing else,

00:08:19.750 --> 00:08:20.720
I'll get back to work.

00:08:21.800 --> 00:08:22.750
Not bad.

00:08:22.850 --> 00:08:23.690
Not bad.

00:08:28.840 --> 00:08:29.680
Just

00:08:30.040 --> 00:08:30.880
ordinary?

00:08:32.840 --> 00:08:34.220
You want to learn cooking from me?

00:08:34.630 --> 00:08:35.480
Of course.

00:08:35.630 --> 00:08:36.870
A man's word

00:08:36.870 --> 00:08:38.220
is his bond.

00:08:38.220 --> 00:08:39.080
I don't care

00:08:39.080 --> 00:08:40.480
who you are.

00:08:40.480 --> 00:08:41.750
I'll be strict no matter what.

00:08:41.750 --> 00:08:42.990
Bring it on.

00:08:43.320 --> 00:08:44.160
No problem.

00:09:07.030 --> 00:09:07.910
How great.

00:09:35.830 --> 00:09:36.850
Milady, just take a look.

00:09:36.850 --> 00:09:37.750
I won't go.

00:09:37.750 --> 00:09:38.990
Just one look.

00:09:39.390 --> 00:09:40.230
Come on.

00:09:40.790 --> 00:09:41.720
Take a look.

00:09:42.910 --> 00:09:44.670
Mr. Shen has worked so hard

00:09:44.960 --> 00:09:46.030
for the Competition.

00:09:47.360 --> 00:09:48.480
He's giving it his all.

00:10:03.990 --> 00:10:04.830
San.

00:10:05.030 --> 00:10:05.870
Here.

00:10:06.080 --> 00:10:06.920
Take this.

00:10:07.200 --> 00:10:08.510
You're working two jobs now.

00:10:08.720 --> 00:10:09.750
You deserve this.

00:10:20.430 --> 00:10:21.580
If you want to practice this,

00:10:21.670 --> 00:10:22.610
you should up the ante.

00:10:33.510 --> 00:10:35.030
Grandpa, you can do it.

00:10:38.560 --> 00:10:40.270
Grandpa, you're amazing.

00:11:05.750 --> 00:11:07.080
Grandpa, are you okay?

00:11:08.750 --> 00:11:09.790
I'm exhausted.

00:11:35.630 --> 00:11:37.150
You scared me.

00:11:39.440 --> 00:11:41.670
Mr. Shen is trying so hard

00:11:42.240 --> 00:11:43.870
to impress you.

00:11:56.560 --> 00:11:58.510
The Competition is quite a spectacle.

00:11:59.020 --> 00:12:01.440
(Culinary Master Competition)
Yong'an is known its for food.

00:12:01.440 --> 00:12:02.770
Today, the famous chefs of Yong'an

00:12:02.840 --> 00:12:04.670
are all going to compete.

00:12:05.390 --> 00:12:07.720
(Guixiang Tavern, Yunlai Tavern)
Juxian boasts delicacies.

00:12:08.030 --> 00:12:10.990
All the chefs in Juxian Alley
will compete.

00:12:11.270 --> 00:12:12.930
Councilor Kang
from the Ministry of Rites

00:12:12.930 --> 00:12:15.140
is the best food connoisseur in Yong'an.

00:12:15.150 --> 00:12:17.440
(Yunlai Tavern)
Whoever gets a good word from him

00:12:17.720 --> 00:12:20.670
is the top in Yong'an.

00:12:21.750 --> 00:12:22.670
Last year,

00:12:22.670 --> 00:12:23.750
the winner was

00:12:23.990 --> 00:12:25.600
(Guixiang Tavern)
Yunlai Tavern.

00:12:29.780 --> 00:12:31.860
(Hermit Suxin)

00:12:36.940 --> 00:12:38.220
(Jinxiu Tavern)

00:13:08.030 --> 00:13:10.670
Aren't you going to watch?

00:13:10.670 --> 00:13:12.240
Shen Jianshe is going to compete.

00:13:12.240 --> 00:13:13.560
Why does that concern me?

00:13:13.560 --> 00:13:14.400
I'm not going.

00:13:15.960 --> 00:13:17.320
- What are you doing?
- Let's go.

00:13:17.670 --> 00:13:19.670
- Don't drag me.
- Let's go.

00:13:19.670 --> 00:13:21.320
(May wealth come)
I won't go.

00:13:21.320 --> 00:13:22.720
I'm not going.

00:13:32.480 --> 00:13:34.270
We're here to make friends through food

00:13:34.560 --> 00:13:35.870
and select the culinary master.

00:13:36.080 --> 00:13:37.200
How fortunate we are

00:13:37.200 --> 00:13:38.040
to have

00:13:38.200 --> 00:13:39.560
Chancellor Meng's presence.

00:13:39.960 --> 00:13:41.670
To be invited by Councilor Kang

00:13:41.670 --> 00:13:43.360
is my honor.

00:13:44.270 --> 00:13:45.870
You're not only here

00:13:46.360 --> 00:13:48.480
but also set the topic for the chefs.

00:13:48.630 --> 00:13:50.030
That's kind enough,

00:13:50.360 --> 00:13:53.480
and you even brought Mr. Lin.

00:13:53.960 --> 00:13:56.440
This truly overwhelms me.

00:13:56.870 --> 00:13:58.480
How dare I accept such praise?

00:13:58.670 --> 00:13:59.510
Alright.

00:13:59.750 --> 00:14:01.440
Don't make him nervous.

00:14:01.870 --> 00:14:03.360
After 40 years,

00:14:03.600 --> 00:14:05.240
you're still so polite.

00:14:06.630 --> 00:14:08.270
We deserve

00:14:08.270 --> 00:14:09.720
each other's respect.

00:14:09.720 --> 00:14:12.320
You understand food the most.

00:14:12.320 --> 00:14:13.840
You've spent a fortune

00:14:14.120 --> 00:14:16.360
on fine cuisine.

00:14:16.360 --> 00:14:17.910
With the younger ones around,

00:14:18.480 --> 00:14:20.270
don't say that about me.

00:14:20.790 --> 00:14:22.480
The people matter to the ruler;

00:14:22.480 --> 00:14:23.750
food matters to the people.

00:14:24.200 --> 00:14:25.080
A good dish can solve

00:14:25.080 --> 00:14:26.270
a thousand worries.

00:14:26.600 --> 00:14:28.360
By promoting the way of fine food,

00:14:28.360 --> 00:14:30.090
Councilor Kang is also
serving the people.

00:14:30.090 --> 00:14:31.300
Look, look.

00:14:31.560 --> 00:14:32.440
Mr. Lin

00:14:32.440 --> 00:14:33.910
truly understands me.

00:14:37.480 --> 00:14:39.790
The Competition hasn't started.

00:14:40.030 --> 00:14:41.030
Why don't we look around,

00:14:41.030 --> 00:14:42.150
Anran?

00:14:42.480 --> 00:14:43.320
Of course.

00:14:44.270 --> 00:14:45.480
Excuse me, thank you.

00:14:47.150 --> 00:14:47.990
Excuse me.

00:14:48.440 --> 00:14:49.830
Mom, over here.

00:14:50.560 --> 00:14:51.400
Come on.

00:14:51.750 --> 00:14:52.590
Jicai,

00:14:52.960 --> 00:14:54.080
no need to hold me.

00:14:54.080 --> 00:14:54.920
Let's go.

00:14:57.270 --> 00:14:58.240
Excuse me.

00:14:58.240 --> 00:14:59.120
Thank you.

00:15:00.150 --> 00:15:00.990
- Father.
- Grandpa.

00:15:05.870 --> 00:15:06.710
Fengxia,

00:15:07.360 --> 00:15:08.200
you came.

00:15:08.750 --> 00:15:10.200
I knew you would.

00:15:11.630 --> 00:15:13.150
I didn't come to see you.

00:15:15.320 --> 00:15:16.870
Jicai, let's go over there.

00:15:17.080 --> 00:15:17.990
Mother.

00:15:18.460 --> 00:15:19.750
- Let's go.
- Grandma.

00:15:19.750 --> 00:15:21.320
- I...
- Let's go.

00:15:21.320 --> 00:15:22.320
Grandpa, you can do it.

00:15:31.200 --> 00:15:33.030
Grandma, their dishes are so strange.

00:15:33.200 --> 00:15:34.040
True.

00:15:34.320 --> 00:15:35.670
I haven't seen anything like it.

00:15:45.670 --> 00:15:46.600
Lady Jingwen.

00:15:49.440 --> 00:15:50.280
Thank you.

00:15:52.320 --> 00:15:53.160
Anyway, Anran

00:15:53.160 --> 00:15:55.560
is about to be engaged to Lady Jingwen.

00:15:55.870 --> 00:15:57.120
No need to talk about this.

00:15:57.720 --> 00:15:58.600
When I left the court,

00:15:58.600 --> 00:15:59.870
Chancellor Meng confirmed it,

00:15:59.870 --> 00:16:01.150
saying Anran is about to become

00:16:01.150 --> 00:16:02.670
his grandson-in-law.

00:16:32.510 --> 00:16:33.910
Mr. Meng will set

00:16:34.440 --> 00:16:36.080
the topic of this year's competition.

00:16:36.750 --> 00:16:37.750
All chefs,

00:16:37.750 --> 00:16:38.890
prepare dishes accordingly.

00:16:39.390 --> 00:16:40.720
Once the dishes are ready,

00:16:40.720 --> 00:16:43.990
the connoisseurs selected
by Councilor Kang will taste them.

00:16:44.440 --> 00:16:46.870
Each connoisseur can cast a chopstick.

00:16:46.990 --> 00:16:48.870
(Shen's Diner)
The one with the most chopsticks

00:16:48.870 --> 00:16:49.960
(Guixiang Tavern)
will win.

00:16:49.960 --> 00:16:51.100
(Yuelai Diner, Hermit Suxin)

00:16:51.100 --> 00:16:52.090
After the topic is given,

00:16:52.240 --> 00:16:54.240
you must prepare the dishes

00:16:54.390 --> 00:16:55.510
in an incense stick of time.

00:16:56.030 --> 00:16:57.670
This year's topic is:

00:17:01.510 --> 00:17:03.600
In youth, we meet with joy.

00:17:04.470 --> 00:17:06.800
At 20, we feel shy.

00:17:07.430 --> 00:17:09.630
At 50, we see the world.

00:17:09.910 --> 00:17:12.560
In old age, we envy the mayfly.

00:17:13.430 --> 00:17:15.520
Jicai, what does this topic mean?

00:17:15.870 --> 00:17:17.120
What is this about?

00:17:18.630 --> 00:17:20.630
It feels like an open topic.

00:17:22.470 --> 00:17:24.670
Please choose your ingredients

00:17:25.120 --> 00:17:26.220
and create a delicious meal.

00:17:34.100 --> 00:17:36.260
(Culinary Master Competition)

00:17:37.850 --> 00:17:39.070
How do we make the dish?

00:17:39.080 --> 00:17:39.950
Based on a poem?

00:17:39.950 --> 00:17:40.950
Yes, that's it.

00:17:47.800 --> 00:17:48.910
Your dad isn't smart enough.

00:17:48.910 --> 00:17:50.630
I don't think he can come up
with anything.

00:17:56.760 --> 00:17:57.870
Mayfly?

00:18:08.080 --> 00:18:10.150
Look, Lady Jingwen is taking something.

00:18:12.040 --> 00:18:13.600
A piece of tofu.

00:18:14.120 --> 00:18:15.160
What can she do with that?

00:18:21.120 --> 00:18:22.320
Yes, that's exactly it.

00:18:25.710 --> 00:18:26.660
This idea is wonderful.

00:18:27.560 --> 00:18:29.120
Everyone else has figured it out.

00:18:32.710 --> 00:18:34.630
Why is your dad still standing there?

00:18:48.230 --> 00:18:49.190
What is he picking?

00:18:54.150 --> 00:18:54.990
He...

00:18:55.710 --> 00:18:56.550
Your dad...

00:19:01.630 --> 00:19:02.880
I'll go over there.

00:19:03.320 --> 00:19:04.160
Grandma.

00:19:05.120 --> 00:19:06.470
Excuse me.

00:19:07.390 --> 00:19:08.870
Excuse me, coming through.

00:19:09.360 --> 00:19:10.200
Shen Jianshe,

00:19:10.900 --> 00:19:12.810
why are you taking
whatever everyone else takes?

00:19:12.870 --> 00:19:14.360
Why copy others now?

00:19:14.760 --> 00:19:16.280
I don't know what to take.

00:19:16.280 --> 00:19:18.000
I just took a bit of everything.

00:19:18.230 --> 00:19:19.080
Can't you use

00:19:19.080 --> 00:19:20.630
your own mind?

00:19:20.630 --> 00:19:21.470
- Ma'am.
- Think.

00:19:21.840 --> 00:19:23.460
Don't interfere with the chefs' cooking.

00:19:23.710 --> 00:19:24.560
Please step back.

00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:25.840
Sorry.

00:19:26.470 --> 00:19:28.710
Youth is the time of studying,

00:19:29.560 --> 00:19:31.150
30 marks adulthood,

00:19:31.950 --> 00:19:33.950
and then it's 50

00:19:34.320 --> 00:19:35.950
and old age.

00:19:36.840 --> 00:19:38.430
What is this topic about?

00:19:39.230 --> 00:19:40.760
Shouldn't Mr. Lin know?

00:19:40.760 --> 00:19:42.360
Why hadn't he come and told us?

00:19:42.600 --> 00:19:44.150
That's cheating.

00:19:45.390 --> 00:19:46.230
Right.

00:19:46.670 --> 00:19:47.510
Have you decided?

00:19:47.670 --> 00:19:49.000
What is a mayfly?

00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:50.630
Jicai, help your father think.

00:19:53.870 --> 00:19:55.230
You set this topic

00:19:55.710 --> 00:19:57.950
to let the chefs infuse
the flavors of life

00:19:58.280 --> 00:19:59.910
into their dishes.

00:20:00.280 --> 00:20:01.520
Am I wrong?

00:20:03.360 --> 00:20:05.230
You're being mysterious,

00:20:05.670 --> 00:20:07.080
but he's already

00:20:07.320 --> 00:20:08.630
seen you through.

00:20:08.840 --> 00:20:10.760
I chose him.

00:20:13.710 --> 00:20:15.040
Of course, he's good.

00:20:26.560 --> 00:20:27.400
What?

00:20:28.390 --> 00:20:29.630
You're planning again?

00:20:30.120 --> 00:20:31.390
You're joking.

00:20:31.670 --> 00:20:32.630
In the Competition,

00:20:32.640 --> 00:20:33.950
everyone has their own plans

00:20:34.240 --> 00:20:35.910
to win.

00:20:39.320 --> 00:20:42.040
Mr. Lin, you keep staring at me.

00:20:43.150 --> 00:20:44.760
Is there something on my face?

Stop wandering, hurry up.

00:22:14.150 --> 00:22:15.150
Grandpa.

00:22:15.630 --> 00:22:17.800
At 20, we feel shy.

00:22:18.360 --> 00:22:20.080
At 50, we see the world.

00:22:20.520 --> 00:22:22.360
There's something about a mayfly.

00:22:22.800 --> 00:22:23.840
Even now, I don't know

00:22:23.840 --> 00:22:25.280
what a mayfly is.

00:22:25.470 --> 00:22:26.520
Hurry up.

00:22:26.520 --> 00:22:27.950
There's not enough time.

00:22:27.950 --> 00:22:29.150
I know.

00:22:42.080 --> 00:22:43.040
I think...

00:22:43.040 --> 00:22:44.360
I think I remember something.

00:22:44.600 --> 00:22:45.870
Tell me if I'm right.

00:22:46.040 --> 00:22:46.880
Studying,

00:22:47.060 --> 00:22:47.950
growing up,

00:22:47.950 --> 00:22:48.790
reaching one's 50s,

00:22:48.950 --> 00:22:50.080
and getting old.

00:22:50.280 --> 00:22:52.470
Isn't this a person's whole life?

00:22:52.470 --> 00:22:53.390
You've become smart.

00:22:53.390 --> 00:22:54.560
- Isn't it?
- Yes.

00:22:54.560 --> 00:22:56.710
So, this is a dish about life, right?

00:22:57.040 --> 00:22:57.910
Hurry up.

00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:00.320
- Keep going.
- That's right.

00:23:00.320 --> 00:23:01.160
I get it.

00:23:01.790 --> 00:23:02.630
I get it now.

00:23:02.630 --> 00:23:03.710
Grandpa is amazing.

00:23:04.120 --> 00:23:05.390
This is easy.

00:23:09.840 --> 00:23:10.760
What's wrong?

00:23:10.760 --> 00:23:11.600
But how should I

00:23:12.120 --> 00:23:13.950
make a dish about life?

00:23:16.230 --> 00:23:17.070
You...

00:23:17.280 --> 00:23:18.600
Hurry up.

00:23:18.600 --> 00:23:20.040
What a mystery.

00:23:21.520 --> 00:23:22.600
He's driving me crazy.

00:23:22.740 --> 00:23:23.710
- Grandpa.
- Keep going.

00:23:23.710 --> 00:23:25.320
- Go for it.
- Keep going.

00:23:25.330 --> 00:23:26.170
Keep going.

00:23:26.180 --> 00:23:27.280
- Go for it.
- Keep going.

00:23:27.470 --> 00:23:28.360
Keep going.

00:23:28.360 --> 00:23:29.200
Go for it.

00:23:29.210 --> 00:23:30.600
Keep going.

00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:31.840
Go for it.

00:23:32.080 --> 00:23:33.320
Always telling me to keep going.

00:23:33.400 --> 00:23:34.670
You all went to the Competition,

00:23:34.670 --> 00:23:35.900
leaving me here alone to wash.

00:23:36.430 --> 00:23:37.760
There's not even a meal.

00:23:38.950 --> 00:23:40.470
Keep going.

00:23:46.230 --> 00:23:47.950
Sir, are there new dishes?

00:23:47.950 --> 00:23:49.600
I can't even finish all these.

00:23:49.760 --> 00:23:50.630
No need to wash.

00:23:50.630 --> 00:23:51.470
Come here.

00:23:55.600 --> 00:23:57.670
Mr. Lu has an important task for you.

00:23:58.320 --> 00:23:59.430
That's great.

00:23:59.430 --> 00:24:01.060
Mr. Lu is finally putting me
to good use.

00:24:01.190 --> 00:24:02.870
Just go ahead and trust me.

00:24:02.870 --> 00:24:04.600
I won't let Mr. Lu down.

00:24:04.600 --> 00:24:06.230
Alright, stop wasting time.

00:24:06.670 --> 00:24:07.630
You

00:24:07.630 --> 00:24:09.430
infiltrate the Competition.

00:24:09.950 --> 00:24:11.630
When someone's dish looks good,

00:24:11.630 --> 00:24:12.800
figure out a way

00:24:13.230 --> 00:24:14.600
to knock over all their dishes.

00:24:17.560 --> 00:24:19.000
Just knock them over?

00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:19.840
That...

00:24:20.600 --> 00:24:22.040
That's too low-class.

00:24:22.040 --> 00:24:22.880
Low-class?

00:24:23.470 --> 00:24:25.040
That's how I made my way up.

00:24:25.470 --> 00:24:26.520
What's low-class about it?

00:24:26.950 --> 00:24:27.840
Feel free

00:24:27.840 --> 00:24:29.630
to use your own method.

00:24:30.520 --> 00:24:32.870
Anyway, no one can surpass Yunlai.

00:24:33.080 --> 00:24:34.200
No, you...

00:24:34.430 --> 00:24:35.270
You...

00:24:38.760 --> 00:24:40.910
(You bunch of villains.)

00:24:52.670 --> 00:24:53.510
By the way...

00:24:57.430 --> 00:25:00.430
Take this.

00:25:02.800 --> 00:25:03.640
Are you

00:25:04.280 --> 00:25:05.120
crazy?

00:25:06.230 --> 00:25:07.070
No.

00:25:07.430 --> 00:25:09.080
I've been sitting for too long.

00:25:09.230 --> 00:25:10.710
Just stretching my limbs.

00:25:13.430 --> 00:25:14.680
- It's okay.
- Stop.

00:25:16.320 --> 00:25:17.430
I forgot to tell you

00:25:19.080 --> 00:25:20.800
to embarrass

00:25:21.320 --> 00:25:22.520
the Shen family.

00:25:24.040 --> 00:25:24.880
Otherwise,

00:25:25.320 --> 00:25:27.430
it won't satisfy Mr. Lu's grudge.

00:25:27.670 --> 00:25:28.510
Also,

00:25:29.320 --> 00:25:30.870
if this doesn't go well,

00:25:31.280 --> 00:25:32.630
Mr. Lu will make you pay.

00:25:35.710 --> 00:25:36.910
Your eyes are wide open.

00:25:37.320 --> 00:25:38.160
Go.

00:25:43.230 --> 00:25:44.560
How...

00:25:56.430 --> 00:25:58.040
Why is Mr. Shen moving so slowly?

00:25:58.040 --> 00:25:59.910
Has he decided what to do?

00:26:00.600 --> 00:26:01.710
With his pace,

00:26:01.710 --> 00:26:03.390
everyone will finish before he does.

00:26:09.190 --> 00:26:10.600
Just make something.

00:26:23.840 --> 00:26:24.800
Go watch over there.

00:26:24.800 --> 00:26:25.870
Wait for my signal later.

00:26:25.870 --> 00:26:26.710
Hurry up and go.

00:26:28.320 --> 00:26:29.160
Go.

00:27:08.950 --> 00:27:09.910
Dad, you can do this.

00:27:12.710 --> 00:27:13.760
That smells so good.

00:27:23.470 --> 00:27:24.310
Dad.

00:27:26.430 --> 00:27:27.270
Dad.

00:27:33.730 --> 00:27:34.600
Dad.

00:27:34.600 --> 00:27:35.440
Yangyang.

00:27:45.670 --> 00:27:46.630
- Yangyang.
- Yangyang.

00:27:49.320 --> 00:27:50.630
Keep it down.

00:27:50.630 --> 00:27:51.800
You human trafficker.

00:27:51.800 --> 00:27:52.800
I'll make you pay.

00:27:52.800 --> 00:27:54.520
Let her go.

00:27:54.800 --> 00:27:56.360
Let her go, let her go.

00:27:56.800 --> 00:27:57.640
Let her go.

00:27:58.230 --> 00:27:59.320
I'll make you pay.

00:27:59.530 --> 00:28:00.400
No, no, stop.

00:28:02.080 --> 00:28:02.920
Gongcai.

00:28:03.190 --> 00:28:04.180
What are you doing here?

00:28:04.320 --> 00:28:05.160
Gongcai.

00:28:07.190 --> 00:28:08.030
This...

00:28:10.470 --> 00:28:11.840
What happened?

00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:13.000
Why are you like this?

00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:13.840
Don't talk.

00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:15.040
Don't call me.

00:28:15.910 --> 00:28:17.150
- Who?
- I'll leave.

00:28:17.150 --> 00:28:18.600
I'll explain later.

00:28:19.710 --> 00:28:20.550
What's going on?

00:28:22.360 --> 00:28:23.250
Chef Shen.

00:28:24.960 --> 00:28:26.120
If you want to practice this,

00:28:26.120 --> 00:28:27.060
you should up the ante.

00:28:29.430 --> 00:28:30.520
I'll explain later.

00:28:30.760 --> 00:28:31.710
I'll tell you later.

00:28:31.710 --> 00:28:32.550
Gongcai.

00:28:34.840 --> 00:28:35.710
Shen.

00:28:35.710 --> 00:28:36.760
- Dad.
- Is it Gongcai?

00:28:36.760 --> 00:28:37.600
Grandpa.

00:28:38.470 --> 00:28:39.320
Is your hand okay?

00:28:39.320 --> 00:28:40.760
Was that Gongcai just now?

00:28:45.430 --> 00:28:46.950
(Anyway, Shen Jianshe hurt his hand.)

00:28:47.280 --> 00:28:48.120
(That works, too.)

00:28:48.980 --> 00:28:49.850
You...

00:28:49.870 --> 00:28:51.040
Your wrist is swollen.

00:28:51.760 --> 00:28:52.800
Stop this.

00:28:52.800 --> 00:28:54.080
Let's go to the clinic now.

00:28:54.080 --> 00:28:55.120
Fengxia, Fengxia.

00:28:55.390 --> 00:28:56.280
Listen to me.

00:28:56.280 --> 00:28:57.120
I'm really fine.

00:29:16.320 --> 00:29:17.470
- Don't worry.
- Mr. Lin.

00:29:17.470 --> 00:29:18.420
I'm not in pain anymore.

00:29:22.710 --> 00:29:23.800
Your hand can't do this.

00:29:23.800 --> 00:29:24.950
You have to go to the clinic.

00:29:24.960 --> 00:29:26.660
Look at how swollen it is.

00:29:26.760 --> 00:29:27.710
Trust me.

00:29:27.710 --> 00:29:28.600
- Uncle.
- I'm fine.

00:29:28.600 --> 00:29:29.440
How's your hand?

00:29:29.710 --> 00:29:30.840
Thanks for your concern.

00:29:31.320 --> 00:29:32.630
My father has an old injury.

00:29:32.800 --> 00:29:34.280
He just hurt it again.

00:29:37.080 --> 00:29:37.920
It's okay, Mr. Lin.

00:29:38.430 --> 00:29:39.390
I can hold on.

00:29:39.670 --> 00:29:40.630
Shen,

00:29:40.630 --> 00:29:42.040
after so long,

00:29:42.040 --> 00:29:43.390
you haven't come up with a dish.

00:29:43.390 --> 00:29:44.760
You don't even know what to do.

00:29:44.760 --> 00:29:45.870
Your wrist is so swollen.

00:29:45.870 --> 00:29:47.040
Why still compete?

00:29:47.040 --> 00:29:48.430
No need to hold on.

00:29:48.430 --> 00:29:49.710
Just go to the clinic already.

00:29:50.320 --> 00:29:51.670
Please, go to the clinic.

00:29:52.390 --> 00:29:53.800
Even if you start now,

00:29:53.800 --> 00:29:54.950
it's too late.

00:29:55.150 --> 00:29:56.470
Dad, let's quit.

00:29:56.470 --> 00:29:58.230
Yeah, go see the physician.

00:29:59.190 --> 00:30:00.950
Right, let's quit.

00:30:00.950 --> 00:30:02.080
Let's go to the clinic.

00:30:04.910 --> 00:30:05.750
Uncle,

00:30:06.040 --> 00:30:07.320
it's better not to force it.

00:30:19.670 --> 00:30:20.510
Fengxia,

00:30:22.280 --> 00:30:24.000
I think I know what dish to make.

00:30:25.430 --> 00:30:26.360
For half my life,

00:30:26.760 --> 00:30:28.470
I've been a failure.

00:30:30.630 --> 00:30:32.520
I've caused a lot of trouble
for you guys

00:30:33.470 --> 00:30:34.800
and made so many mistakes.

00:30:36.950 --> 00:30:38.520
I've been preparing for the Competition

00:30:39.230 --> 00:30:40.470
for a long time.

00:30:40.800 --> 00:30:41.640
Really.

00:30:42.190 --> 00:30:44.280
The result doesn't matter to me.

00:30:45.150 --> 00:30:46.710
I just want a chance

00:30:47.560 --> 00:30:49.800
to prove myself in front of my family

00:30:52.430 --> 00:30:53.270
that I can do it.

00:31:00.560 --> 00:31:01.400
Okay.

00:31:02.520 --> 00:31:03.520
Then be careful.

00:31:04.630 --> 00:31:05.470
You can do this.

00:31:07.040 --> 00:31:07.880
Alright.

00:31:09.520 --> 00:31:10.360
You can do this.

00:31:10.800 --> 00:31:11.840
Grandpa, go for it.

00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:13.840
You can do this.

(Culinary Master Competition)

00:33:57.760 --> 00:33:59.430
Hermit Suxin

00:34:00.040 --> 00:34:02.120
presents four bowls of plain soup,

00:34:02.120 --> 00:34:03.330
each with a different flavor.

00:34:03.910 --> 00:34:05.470
There seems to be a deeper meaning.

00:34:05.710 --> 00:34:07.190
To have Councilor Kang my dishes,

00:34:07.600 --> 00:34:09.230
I dare not be careless.

00:34:17.480 --> 00:34:19.440
The noodle slices in the first bowl

00:34:19.440 --> 00:34:20.670
are as tender as new leaves,

00:34:21.710 --> 00:34:24.000
placed in a soup of honeysuckle

00:34:24.830 --> 00:34:26.310
and sophora flowers.

00:34:26.880 --> 00:34:29.080
Like a newborn baby's

00:34:29.080 --> 00:34:30.190
third-day bath,

00:34:30.520 --> 00:34:31.560
symbolizing rebirth.

00:34:31.560 --> 00:34:33.000
So, it's called Rebirth Soup.

00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:33.960
How wonderful.

00:34:43.080 --> 00:34:44.520
In the second bowl,

00:34:45.350 --> 00:34:46.190
you put cherries

00:34:46.630 --> 00:34:48.480
in the soup?

00:34:49.670 --> 00:34:50.670
Let me guess.

00:34:51.150 --> 00:34:52.750
The cherry season...

00:34:53.190 --> 00:34:54.190
Cherry...

00:34:57.480 --> 00:34:59.670
Isn't it time to reveal results?

00:35:01.400 --> 00:35:02.520
You saw through everything.

00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:04.670
This is called Success Soup,

00:35:04.670 --> 00:35:06.270
symbolizing passing the exams.

00:35:06.560 --> 00:35:07.400
Interesting.

00:35:07.790 --> 00:35:10.310
You're trying to incorporate
the most important moments of life

00:35:10.560 --> 00:35:11.920
into these dishes.

00:35:12.560 --> 00:35:14.190
In the third bowl,

00:35:14.190 --> 00:35:15.150
there are lotus seeds,

00:35:15.150 --> 00:35:16.720
longan, and white fungus.

00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:18.190
It should be called

00:35:18.600 --> 00:35:19.750
Family Soup, right?

00:35:19.870 --> 00:35:20.790
Exactly.

00:35:20.790 --> 00:35:22.270
It's to wish for kids.

00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:25.840
Good.

00:35:28.480 --> 00:35:29.520
Is this tofu thread?

00:35:38.190 --> 00:35:40.400
The soup in the fourth bowl

00:35:40.830 --> 00:35:42.150
has a different flavor.

00:35:43.230 --> 00:35:44.630
Not very tasteful.

00:35:44.630 --> 00:35:45.710
Because this one

00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:47.440
is to commemorate separation,

00:35:47.750 --> 00:35:48.930
symbolizing the end of life.

00:35:49.960 --> 00:35:51.080
The flavors of life

00:35:51.080 --> 00:35:53.270
are all in this Four-Flavor Soup.

00:35:54.630 --> 00:35:56.040
I see.

00:36:03.350 --> 00:36:04.520
How wonderful.

00:36:04.790 --> 00:36:07.270
Every dish from Guixiang Tavern

00:36:07.270 --> 00:36:09.960
is inspired by a poem.

00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:13.880
The wind has turned the grass green,

00:36:14.350 --> 00:36:18.270
bringing spring to purple
and red buildings.

00:36:19.080 --> 00:36:21.790
Only the lotus,
accompanied by green leaves,

00:36:21.790 --> 00:36:25.040
unfurls and closes
as naturally as it can.

00:36:25.190 --> 00:36:27.790
Only the chrysanthemums
can withstand the cold.

00:36:28.120 --> 00:36:31.270
When it blooms,
the morning is filled with an aroma.

00:36:32.310 --> 00:36:34.710
When snowflakes drift into the house,

00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:39.120
I sit and watch
the green bamboo turn white.

00:36:40.150 --> 00:36:40.990
Good.

00:36:41.710 --> 00:36:42.550
Good.

00:36:45.880 --> 00:36:47.310
These four dishes

00:36:47.710 --> 00:36:50.480
represent the four seasons.

00:36:50.480 --> 00:36:51.630
Yes.

00:36:55.820 --> 00:36:58.300
(Yunlai Tavern)

00:37:00.830 --> 00:37:02.000
This is amazing.

00:37:02.440 --> 00:37:03.960
It's a kind of splendor

00:37:03.960 --> 00:37:06.120
that I've never seen before.

00:37:06.750 --> 00:37:07.590
The fish.

00:37:08.120 --> 00:37:09.120
The carving work.

00:37:09.400 --> 00:37:10.710
They're

00:37:11.120 --> 00:37:12.350
the most expensive dishes here.

00:37:12.350 --> 00:37:13.350
Yes.

00:37:18.350 --> 00:37:21.000
I can't even bear
to destroy it with a bite.

00:37:25.350 --> 00:37:26.190
Please.

00:37:29.750 --> 00:37:30.590
Are these

00:37:30.880 --> 00:37:32.230
six home-cooked dishes?

00:37:33.150 --> 00:37:34.920
Actually, this is one dish

00:37:35.630 --> 00:37:37.080
called Six Bowls.

00:37:37.400 --> 00:37:38.750
The chef usually puts

00:37:38.750 --> 00:37:40.120
the dishes that are hard to forget

00:37:40.120 --> 00:37:41.870
on one plate.

00:37:43.000 --> 00:37:45.520
It's your diner

00:37:45.520 --> 00:37:47.000
that makes the pork dish

00:37:47.630 --> 00:37:50.190
(Shen's Diner)
what it is today.

00:37:50.920 --> 00:37:53.120
The others are nothing special.

00:38:06.270 --> 00:38:07.880
The taste must be very homey.

00:38:08.960 --> 00:38:10.080
The more homey it is,

00:38:10.440 --> 00:38:11.630
the more precious it is.

00:38:12.880 --> 00:38:14.230
After a family has worked all day,

00:38:14.560 --> 00:38:15.480
they come home

00:38:15.750 --> 00:38:17.270
and sit around a table,

00:38:17.750 --> 00:38:19.000
sharing the Six Bowls.

00:38:19.630 --> 00:38:21.000
When eating these dishes,

00:38:21.560 --> 00:38:23.080
there is no taste of loneliness.

00:38:24.710 --> 00:38:26.560
The Six Bowls don't need to be special,

00:38:27.440 --> 00:38:29.040
as long as the family likes them.

00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:31.440
Before coming to the Competition,

00:38:32.040 --> 00:38:33.790
I also thought about winning first place

00:38:34.080 --> 00:38:35.480
to prove myself.

00:38:35.670 --> 00:38:37.190
But when I picked up the knife

00:38:37.710 --> 00:38:39.000
and started the fire to cook,

00:38:39.710 --> 00:38:40.960
all I could think of

00:38:41.350 --> 00:38:43.230
was the flavors my family likes.

00:38:44.120 --> 00:38:45.400
My son loves meat.

00:38:46.080 --> 00:38:46.920
My daughter

00:38:47.710 --> 00:38:48.550
and Deyuan

00:38:48.830 --> 00:38:50.120
love the dishes I stir-fry.

00:38:55.040 --> 00:38:56.310
My beloved wife

00:38:56.920 --> 00:38:58.600
likes some small seafood.

00:39:00.040 --> 00:39:01.440
My granddaughter Yangyang

00:39:02.310 --> 00:39:03.630
loves desserts.

00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:06.790
There is also a special family member

00:39:09.630 --> 00:39:11.080
who loves rice tofu.

00:39:18.920 --> 00:39:19.880
At this moment,

00:39:20.770 --> 00:39:22.190
the result doesn't matter.

00:39:22.960 --> 00:39:24.350
Not at all.

00:39:24.790 --> 00:39:26.600
If I have to choose one dish

00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:28.040
to represent life,

00:39:28.670 --> 00:39:29.510
I would say

00:39:30.230 --> 00:39:31.070
this dish

00:39:31.230 --> 00:39:33.230
must be the one
that my family and I often eat,

00:39:33.670 --> 00:39:34.520
must eat,

00:39:35.040 --> 00:39:36.000
and have eaten.

00:39:36.920 --> 00:39:38.520
A family is always together,

00:39:39.150 --> 00:39:40.350
enjoying every meal.

00:39:41.560 --> 00:39:42.830
That is the most important thing

00:39:44.150 --> 00:39:45.310
in life.

00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:01.070
