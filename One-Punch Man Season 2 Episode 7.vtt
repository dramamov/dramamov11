<b>Any vulgarian can finish

<b>For generations, my ancestors bred only

<b>but ultimately,</b>

06:20.560 --> 06:22.480
<b>this world will be mine to rule!</b>

06:24.980 --> 06:27.490
<b>So you're kinda like GMO corn or something?</b>

06:28.600 --> 06:29.910
<b>I will murder you.</b>

<b>How exquisite to see your eyes filled with tears,

06:35.740 --> 06:36.700
<b>Begin!</b>

06:37.660 --> 06:41.210
<b>Another single-hit knockout!</b>

<b>Charanko advances unscathed to the finals!</b>

<b>The tournament's already ending?</b>

<b>Charanko's power knows no bounds!</b>

<b>We've lost contact with the Class A heroes in City I!</b>

06:56.020 --> 06:57.260
<b>Understood.</b>

06:57.260 --> 06:58.430
<b>Summon a Class S—</b>

06:58.430 --> 06:59.660
<b>Hold it!</b>

07:01.940 --> 07:04.400
<b>I've been hiding under the rubble,</b>

07:06.680 --> 07:08.650
<b>waiting for reinforcements to get here!</b>

07:09.200 --> 07:11.240
<b>Now we've got all these Class A heroes.</b>

07:11.700 --> 07:13.690
<b>We can handle this.</b>

07:13.690 --> 07:15.530
<b>No. You'll do no good.</b>

07:16.100 --> 07:18.540
<b>To fight a foe with inadequate force</b>

07:18.540 --> 07:21.170
<b>only heightens the damage to one's self.</b>

07:21.170 --> 07:23.000
Class S,

Class S,

07:24.630 --> 07:26.380
<b>Shut up and watch.</b>

07:46.600 --> 07:48.190
<b>So that's Class S power...?</b>

07:58.330 --> 08:01.250
<b>Isn't this causing even greater damage?!</b>

08:06.380 --> 08:07.040
<b>You stop it?</b>

08:07.040 --> 08:08.800
<b>Just pecked at its wounds.</b>

08:12.720 --> 08:15.260
<b>This may call for my ultimate technique.</b>

08:27.600 --> 08:28.440
<b>That's...</b>

08:29.050 --> 08:30.820
<b>Terrible Tornado!</b>

08:48.290 --> 08:50.080
<b>You there!</b>

08:50.550 --> 08:55.180
<b>Why're you all screwing around
 when we're shorthanded?!</b>

08:55.500 --> 08:56.930
<b>We were fighting this octo—</b>

08:56.930 --> 08:58.260
<b>You especially!</b>

08:58.260 --> 09:00.480
<b>"Flashy Flash", was it?</b>

09:00.480 --> 09:04.270
<b>You're supposed to be Class S,
 so start acting like one!</b>

09:05.790 --> 09:07.500
<b>Useless jerks.</b>

09:09.090 --> 09:12.530
<b>Says the air-headed woman 
who dropped in to steal my kill?</b>

09:12.930 --> 09:14.900
<b>You presume you're stronger than me?!</b>

09:14.900 --> 09:16.240
<b>Yo, what if she hears you?</b>

09:16.550 --> 09:19.120
<b>Don't get us in trouble with her!</b>

09:20.560 --> 09:22.080
<b>Such an arrogant brute.</b>

09:24.770 --> 09:27.790
<b><i>We were no help at all...</i></b>

09:27.970 --> 09:32.730
<b>As I predicted, Class S heroes are most troublesome.</b>

09:32.730 --> 09:34.220
<b>It is of no consequence.</b>

09:35.030 --> 09:38.220
<b>We can make any number of monsters.</b>

<b>You're probably all aware 
of why I've gathered you here.</b>

09:45.680 --> 09:48.350
<b>It involves the hero hunter, Garou.</b>

09:48.920 --> 09:53.050
<b>Silverfang is currently pursuing him.</b>

09:53.050 --> 09:53.480
<b>However,</b>

09:54.510 --> 09:57.200
<b>it's possible Garou might defeat the old man.</b>

09:58.580 --> 10:01.660
<b>Granted, Silverfang's skills are beyond reproach.</b>

10:01.660 --> 10:04.140
<b>But he is up against his former student.</b>

10:04.140 --> 10:06.190
<b>He might go easy on the boy.</b>

10:06.190 --> 10:06.910
<b>Therefore,</b>

10:06.910 --> 10:12.040
<b>we of the Holy Order of the Sword 
will find Garou first, and kill him.</b>

10:12.340 --> 10:14.660
<b>To find him, we need numbers.</b>

10:14.660 --> 10:16.480
<b>I'm asking for your help.</b>

10:16.480 --> 10:19.610
<b>You are the strongest swordsmen we have.</b>

10:19.610 --> 10:22.560
<b>He must be quite a threat for you to ask this...</b>

10:22.870 --> 10:24.210
<b>All right.</b>

10:24.210 --> 10:25.990
<b>I'll send out my disciples.</b>

10:25.990 --> 10:27.020
<b>Amahare...</b>

10:27.020 --> 10:29.830
<b>You were right to ask us.</b>

10:29.830 --> 10:30.860
<b>Zanbai...</b>

10:30.860 --> 10:33.300
<b>Consider it as good as done.</b>

10:33.300 --> 10:34.360
<b>Nichirin...</b>

10:34.360 --> 10:35.450
<b>Thank you all.</b>

10:35.450 --> 10:37.440
<b>I'll make it up to—</b>

10:39.150 --> 10:42.700
<b>Since when is the Holy Order of the Sword
 a neighborhood watch?</b>

10:43.400 --> 10:44.410
<b>Haragiri...</b>

10:44.410 --> 10:46.850
<b>Our aim is to achieve true skill.</b>

10:46.850 --> 10:50.630
<b>Improving our art is all 
that concerns the Holy Order.</b>

10:50.630 --> 10:52.710
<b>Enough, you're drunk. Let's—</b>

10:52.710 --> 10:56.210
<b>Quiet. I'm not done speaking.</b>

10:56.210 --> 10:57.920
<b>I have something special here.</b>

11:01.170 --> 11:02.720
<b>Monster cells.</b>

11:03.090 --> 11:05.140
<b>By incorporating them into one's body,</b>

11:05.140 --> 11:07.730
<b>one obtains power surpassing human limits!</b>

11:09.870 --> 11:11.690
<b>In other words, we can be monsters ourselves!</b>

11:11.690 --> 11:13.150
<b>He's gone mad.</b>

11:13.150 --> 11:14.360
<b>Where did you get these?</b>

11:14.360 --> 11:18.660
<b>The monsters have formed a Monster Association.</b>

11:18.660 --> 11:20.490
<b>They approached me.</b>

11:20.850 --> 11:24.310
<b>By surrendering my humanity,
 I was allowed to join them</b>

11:24.310 --> 11:27.120
<b>and was given strength beyond
 what this flesh could offer.</b>

11:27.120 --> 11:28.620
<b>Tell me you didn't...</b>

11:28.620 --> 11:29.850
<b>Of course I did!</b>

11:29.850 --> 11:31.790
<b>I am no longer some mere human.</b>

11:31.790 --> 11:35.090
<b>The power flowing through me is unbelievable.</b>

11:35.090 --> 11:37.950
<b>Gentlemen, you must become monsters too!</b>

11:39.130 --> 11:41.450
<b>You've fallen from the path, Haragiri.</b>

11:42.810 --> 11:46.790
<b>With my quick draw,
 I can sever all four of your heads at once.</b>

11:47.300 --> 11:49.600
<b>Any who refuses, dies!</b>

11:51.420 --> 11:52.520
<b>Such a pity.</b>

11:52.520 --> 11:55.370
<b>A pity indeed, Atomic Samurai.</b>

11:55.370 --> 11:58.450
<b>For I was told to kill you, regardless.</b>

11:58.450 --> 11:59.810
<b>You have three seconds!</b>

11:59.810 --> 12:01.990
<b>Eat the monster cells!</b>

12:02.300 --> 12:02.950
<b>3! 2! 1!</b>

12:02.950 --> 12:03.860
<b>3! 2! 1!</b>

12:03.860 --> 12:04.950
<b>3! 2! 1!</b>

12:06.400 --> 12:09.370
<b>The rest of us aren't fools like you.</b>

12:21.940 --> 12:22.760
<b>We're going.</b>

12:23.550 --> 12:25.090
<b>But we've got a new target:</b>

12:25.090 --> 12:27.290
<b>the Monster Association.</b>

12:28.480 --> 12:32.020
<b>Welcome to the Super Fight final match!</b>

12:32.490 --> 12:36.250
<b>The seedings had Charanko
 as an overwhelming underdog,</b>

12:36.250 --> 12:40.440
<b>but we might have an incredible upset on our hands!</b>

12:43.530 --> 12:48.120
<b>By the sound of it,
 the fans in the stadium sense something, too!</b>

12:48.120 --> 12:51.310
<b>But this man will have no part of it!</b>

12:51.310 --> 12:54.040
<b>It seems unthinkable that
 he'd struggle against anyone!</b>

12:54.340 --> 12:56.250
<b>Suiryu of the Dark Corporeal Fist,</b>

12:56.250 --> 12:59.260
<b>versus Charanko's 
Fist of Seltzer Water on the Rocks!</b>

12:59.260 --> 13:01.960
<b><i>Is this guy on to my rug?</i></b>

13:01.960 --> 13:04.430
<b>Who will emerge victorious?</b>

13:04.860 --> 13:07.720
<b>Oh! Suiryu is grinning!</b>

13:07.720 --> 13:09.760
<b>Has he sensed he's got his opponent outclassed?</b>

13:10.240 --> 13:15.170
<b>Charanko seems to be trying to hide
 his nervousness by looking like a doofus!</b>

13:15.170 --> 13:16.730
<b><i>This is how I always look.</i></b>

13:17.220 --> 13:18.020
<b>Take your stances!</b>

13:18.450 --> 13:20.020
<b>Let's enjoy ourselves, Charanko.</b>

13:20.450 --> 13:21.060
<b>Huh?</b>

13:21.060 --> 13:21.900
<b>Begin!</b>

13:21.900 --> 13:24.400
<b>The fight begins!</b>

13:25.260 --> 13:25.740
<b>Watch it!</b>

13:26.700 --> 13:29.300
<b>Suiryu takes the offensive!</b>

13:29.300 --> 13:32.540
<b>But for some reason, he stops just short!</b>

13:34.600 --> 13:37.540
<b>H-He's attacking with such speed!</b>

13:38.220 --> 13:40.790
<b><i>Since it's the finals, I wanted to see his moves,</i></b>

13:41.180 --> 13:43.400
<b><i>but that wind is gonna be a problem.</i></b>

13:43.400 --> 13:45.170
<b><i>Is he doing that on purpose?</i></b>

13:45.170 --> 13:46.470
<b>What's the matter?</b>

13:46.470 --> 13:48.390
<b>I know you can see it coming.</b>

13:49.510 --> 13:51.010
<b>Kick after kick!</b>

13:51.010 --> 13:53.540
<b>But he's stopping just short every time!</b>

13:53.540 --> 13:57.000
<b>All Charanko can do is guard his head.</b>

13:57.000 --> 13:59.270
<b>Has he already lost the will to fight?</b>

13:59.270 --> 14:01.540
<b>The ring announcer is clueless.</b>

14:01.540 --> 14:03.320
<b>I was just warming up.</b>

14:03.860 --> 14:05.700
<b>You're strong.</b>

14:05.700 --> 14:07.910
<b>I can tell since I'm strong too.</b>

14:09.230 --> 14:11.530
<b><i>So he's not trying to blow the wig off?</i></b>

14:11.530 --> 14:12.790
<b>It's your eyes...</b>

14:13.080 --> 14:15.060
<b>They aren't seeking rank or glory.</b>

14:15.060 --> 14:17.710
<b>Your eyes are looking for something fun.</b>

14:17.710 --> 14:18.880
<b>Well...</b>

14:18.880 --> 14:20.000
<b>you might be right.</b>

14:20.380 --> 14:23.130
<b>Why'd you enter this tournament?</b>

14:23.550 --> 14:25.710
<b>I'm in it for the prize money.</b>

14:25.710 --> 14:27.420
<b><i>That's what I'm after too.</i></b>

14:27.420 --> 14:29.010
<b>And I got one more reason.</b>

14:29.660 --> 14:33.440
<b>I want to fight good opponents.</b>

14:33.440 --> 14:35.830
<b>Of course, in the end I'm gonna win,</b>

14:35.830 --> 14:37.600
<b>but the process is fun, you know?</b>

14:38.520 --> 14:40.520
<b>Fun... you say.</b>

14:40.520 --> 14:42.400
<b>Yeah. It's fun being strong.</b>

14:43.180 --> 14:44.270
<b><i>I see...</i></b>

14:45.860 --> 14:49.260
<b>I came here to experience martial arts.</b>

14:49.260 --> 14:51.290
<b>I heard the fighters here were strong,</b>

14:51.290 --> 14:54.210
<b>but if I fought back even a little, the match was over.</b>

14:54.670 --> 14:56.650
<b>What're they gabbing about?</b>

14:56.650 --> 15:00.980
<b>Probably the road full of hardships
 it took to come so far.</b>

15:00.980 --> 15:03.950
<b>I was starting to think 
coming here was a waste of time,</b>

15:04.730 --> 15:06.840
<b>but you seem different.</b>

15:08.760 --> 15:09.680
<b>I see.</b>

15:10.140 --> 15:12.250
<b>Then how about we do it this way?</b>

15:12.250 --> 15:14.650
<b>I'll let you experience martial arts,</b>

15:14.650 --> 15:17.560
<b>and you do your best to make it fun for me.</b>

15:17.890 --> 15:19.520
<b>Oh, I like that.</b>

15:19.950 --> 15:21.020
<b>Okay, then...</b>

15:21.710 --> 15:23.240
<b>Shall we begin?</b>

15:24.340 --> 15:24.730
<b>Here goes!</b>

15:26.940 --> 15:30.030
<b>Th-That was even faster than before!</b>

15:32.700 --> 15:35.410
<b>Suiryu's getting serious!</b>

15:35.410 --> 15:36.990
<b>I won't let up!</b>

15:38.200 --> 15:40.330
<b>Charanko's been launched!</b>

15:45.340 --> 15:46.630
<b>Safe.</b>

15:47.930 --> 15:49.760
<b>D-Down he goes!</b>

15:51.110 --> 15:53.340
<b>Is Charanko okay?</b>

15:53.730 --> 15:55.600
<b>Will he even be able to stand up?</b>

15:55.600 --> 15:57.530
<b>Ch-Charanko!</b>

15:57.530 --> 15:59.890
<b>Their ability levels were too far apart.</b>

16:00.480 --> 16:02.230
<b>Did I go too hard?</b>

16:02.230 --> 16:04.980
<b>That last one had me scared.</b>

16:06.070 --> 16:08.360
<b><i>I thought for sure my wig was coming off.</i></b>

16:09.870 --> 16:10.610
<b>All right.</b>

16:10.890 --> 16:12.990
<b>This is how it should be!</b>

16:13.680 --> 16:15.490
<b>H-He's really hanging in there!</b>

16:15.940 --> 16:18.400
<b>If he holds on, his chance might come!</b>

16:18.400 --> 16:19.500
<b>No...</b>

16:19.500 --> 16:20.870
<b>Look at Suiryu.</b>

16:21.210 --> 16:23.290
<b>He's only been using leg techniques.</b>

16:23.290 --> 16:26.170
<b>He's holding back and toying with his prey.</b>

16:26.170 --> 16:27.510
<b>That means...</b>

16:27.510 --> 16:29.420
<b>...he hasn't gotten serious yet.</b>

16:29.420 --> 16:31.930
<b>Your weapon is your punch, right?</b>

16:31.930 --> 16:33.130
<b>C'mon, hit me.</b>

16:33.130 --> 16:35.260
<b>Make it fun.</b>

16:40.270 --> 16:43.530
<b><i>He read that I was going for a countermove.</i></b>

16:43.530 --> 16:46.520
<b><i>He may be a white belt,
 but he has real fight experience.</i></b>

16:47.120 --> 16:49.980
<b><i>The way he protects only 
his head shows sharp instincts.</i></b>

16:50.560 --> 16:53.110
<b>What's your day job?</b>

16:53.410 --> 16:54.640
<b>My day job?</b>

16:54.640 --> 16:57.370
<b>Uh... going for walks, defeating monsters...</b>

16:57.780 --> 16:58.710
<b>What?</b>

16:58.710 --> 17:00.820
<b>You fight monsters?</b>

17:00.820 --> 17:03.570
<b>It's almost as if you're doing hero stuff.</b>

17:03.570 --> 17:04.890
<b>W-Well...</b>

17:04.890 --> 17:07.430
<b>I figured I might be a hero someday.</b>

17:07.430 --> 17:10.880
<b>Another one aiming to become a hero...</b>

17:11.570 --> 17:14.220
<b>Doesn't seem like a job for a quality fighter.</b>

17:15.920 --> 17:19.020
<b>I fought a few Class A heroes earlier,</b>

17:19.020 --> 17:20.720
<b>but they were so weak!</b>

17:21.450 --> 17:23.060
<b>They're heroes in name only.</b>

17:23.950 --> 17:29.020
<b>Their job is just flaunting virtue and 
justice to make people feel indebted.</b>

17:29.020 --> 17:31.910
<b>At their level, no matter how hard they try,</b>

17:31.910 --> 17:34.240
<b>they're not gonna save the world.</b>

17:34.240 --> 17:37.650
<b>Fine intentions, noble thoughts,</b>

17:37.650 --> 17:40.990
<b>lofty morals, heroic justice...</b>

17:41.400 --> 17:46.870
<b>They're impurities that create boredom
 in the life of fun that I seek.</b>

17:47.360 --> 17:49.050
<b>You're strong like me,</b>

17:49.050 --> 17:52.960
<b>so why not live free and easy 
without that crap holding you back?</b>

17:54.150 --> 17:54.960
<b>Huh?</b>

17:54.960 --> 17:56.530
<b>Hit too close to home?</b>

17:56.530 --> 18:00.260
<b>I offer advice because I see
 you're one of the strong, but...</b>

18:00.930 --> 18:03.190
<b>A clean hit!</b>

18:03.190 --> 18:03.640
<b>Wait...</b>

18:04.610 --> 18:06.470
<b>Impurities?</b>

18:06.470 --> 18:08.210
<b>What's that got to do with it?</b>

18:09.140 --> 18:11.970
<b>You're not the only one doing what he wants to do.</b>

18:11.970 --> 18:13.980
<b>Suiryu, was it?</b>

18:13.980 --> 18:15.650
<b>Here's some advice from me.</b>

18:17.970 --> 18:19.930
<b>If what you're after is having fun,</b>

18:19.930 --> 18:22.490
<b>don't get any stronger.</b>

18:28.290 --> 18:30.650
<b>Dang, I keep doing that...</b>

18:30.650 --> 18:32.790
<b>I almost ended it too quick again.</b>

18:35.210 --> 18:37.420
<b>Wh-What the heck happened?!</b>

18:35.210 --> 18:37.420
<b>Did you see that?!</b>

18:37.420 --> 18:38.570
<b>A-Amazing!</b>

18:38.570 --> 18:40.050
<b>M-My goodness!</b>

18:40.050 --> 18:42.970
<b>A shocking development regarding Charanko!</b>

18:42.970 --> 18:47.180
<b>He's been outed as wearing a wig!</b>

18:47.760 --> 18:49.940
<b>The referee is conferring with the judges.</b>

18:49.940 --> 18:51.150
<b>Could this mean...</b>

18:51.700 --> 18:53.230
<b>I will now explain the stoppage.</b>

18:53.790 --> 18:56.980
<b>After the "Wolfman Incident"
 of the last tournament,</b>

18:56.980 --> 19:00.860
<b>the rules have been changed 
starting with this tournament.</b>

19:00.860 --> 19:04.760
<b>Masks and other head coverings are now prohibited.</b>

19:04.760 --> 19:06.790
<b>His wig has been ruled a head covering.</b>

19:06.790 --> 19:07.750
<b>Accordingly,</b>

19:08.230 --> 19:10.300
<b>Charanko is disqualified!</b>

19:10.300 --> 19:11.720
<b>A-Amazing!</b>

19:11.720 --> 19:13.750
<b>The match has ended!</b>

19:13.750 --> 19:16.280
<b>Suiryu has secured victory!</b>

19:16.280 --> 19:17.460
<b>This is a joke!</b>

19:17.460 --> 19:18.760
<b>Let the match continue!</b>

19:18.760 --> 19:23.240
<b>Charanko's so young to be 
carrying such hidden tragedy...</b>

19:23.240 --> 19:24.850
<b>No, that's probably an imposter.</b>

19:24.850 --> 19:27.140
<b>Saitama? What's he doing here?</b>

19:27.140 --> 19:28.930
<b>You know him?</b>

19:28.930 --> 19:32.210
<b>We'll confirm later you're who you claim to be.</b>

19:32.210 --> 19:32.990
<b><i>Time to go.</i></b>

19:32.990 --> 19:34.900
<b>Playtime's over.</b>

19:35.930 --> 19:38.010
<b>Now, we fight for real.</b>

19:39.820 --> 19:40.200
<b>What?!</b>

19:42.910 --> 19:46.370
<b>I still haven't shown you what I can really do!</b>

19:51.420 --> 19:53.500
<b>The ring split in two!</b>

20:10.060 --> 20:12.640

20:12.640 --> 20:13.300
<b>Yeah!</b>

20:13.300 --> 20:14.280
<b>Keep going!</b>

20:14.280 --> 20:15.150

20:17.880 --> 20:20.900
<b>Suiryu seems a man possessed!</b>

20:20.900 --> 20:23.480
<b>I've never seen him like this before!</b>

20:23.480 --> 20:27.580
<b>Now you'll understand. This is martial arts!</b>

20:28.230 --> 20:31.750
<b>Dark Body Flying Dragon Fist!</b>

<b>Th-There's no stopping!</b>

20:36.170 --> 20:38.670
<b>I'm not getting to him.</b>

20:42.370 --> 20:44.180
<b>The ring cracked!</b>

20:44.180 --> 20:46.210
<b>That power stance...</b>

20:46.210 --> 20:47.100
<b>He's gonna kill him.</b>

20:47.100 --> 20:48.220
<b>Get away!</b>

20:55.500 --> 20:56.940
<b>That didn't...?!</b>

20:56.940 --> 20:59.650
<b>I see... I think I'm beginning to understand.</b>

20:59.650 --> 21:03.030
<b>So I've given you an inkling 
of what martial arts truly are?</b>

21:03.720 --> 21:05.880
<b>Martial arts are essentially...</b>

21:06.530 --> 21:09.240
<b>...moves that look cool.</b>

21:11.750 --> 21:13.120
