(The Sweet Lie)

00:01:21.319 --> 00:01:22.120
Yan.

00:01:36.879 --> 00:01:38.040
You're finally awake.

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:43.319
How silly of you.

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:46.120
Why were you at the Nine Soul Bridge?

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:49.040
It was a bottomless abyss down there.

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:51.640
If you fell, that'd be terrible.

00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:00.239
You've always protected me before.

00:02:01.239 --> 00:02:03.280
I wanted to protect you this time.

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:07.120
You're my wife.

00:02:08.639 --> 00:02:09.960
It's my duty to protect you.

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:16.680
I just want to hold you like this.

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:19.439
All the time.

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:21.879
I want to always be with you

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:24.280
and lead a peaceful life.

00:02:27.919 --> 00:02:29.159
Nothing

00:02:30.159 --> 00:02:31.680
could ever separate us again.

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:33.639
Not even death

00:02:35.319 --> 00:02:37.159
could tear us apart.

00:02:39.719 --> 00:02:40.080
Yes.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:42.120
We'll never be apart again.

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:14.719
Lu Huayan was able to reenter the dream
and retrieve the Bodhi Fruit.

00:03:16.439 --> 00:03:17.479
Did you help him?

00:03:17.639 --> 00:03:19.280
(Li Motong)
I helped Li Motong.

00:03:19.919 --> 00:03:21.319
As the Supreme Priest of Wujian,

00:03:21.479 --> 00:03:23.760
I couldn't just stand by
and watch the Lord of Wujian

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:25.240
suffer from the Heart-Devouring Curse.

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:27.159
He brought all of this upon himself!

00:03:27.719 --> 00:03:29.960
If he had followed the plan,

00:03:30.439 --> 00:03:32.639
he wouldn't be suffering like this.

00:03:32.759 --> 00:03:34.360
Due to what he did,

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:36.879
even the Soul-Eating Sword is gone now.

00:03:36.879 --> 00:03:37.990
Tell me. What do we do now?

00:03:42.759 --> 00:03:44.520
I'm willing to sacrifice all my power

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:45.840
to reforge the sword's soul.

00:03:46.479 --> 00:03:47.280
For real?

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:49.510
When that time comes,

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:51.380
the Soul-Eating Sword
infused with all my power

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:52.840
will be even stronger than before.

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:55.420
We'll no longer need to wait
until the night of the Crimson Moon.

00:03:55.439 --> 00:03:56.879
You're sacrificing so much

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:01.639
just to keep Li Motong alive,
aren't you?

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:05.280
It's been hundreds of years

00:04:06.639 --> 00:04:08.120
and you still love him.

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:18.959
Three days from now,

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:20.460
the Soul-Eating Sword will be complete.

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:22.079
We'll decide what to do then.

00:04:25.519 --> 00:04:26.480
See your way out.

00:04:27.839 --> 00:04:28.759
So that's how it is.

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:32.959
He's a fool.

00:04:35.079 --> 00:04:36.079
So are you.

00:04:46.639 --> 00:04:48.240
Yan, we're done for the day.

00:04:49.079 --> 00:04:50.480
Today's rehearsal went really well.

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:51.670
Thank you for your hard work.

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:52.680
I'll off.

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:06.990
What are you doing here?

00:05:07.639 --> 00:05:08.480
Lu Huayan.

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:11.079
Why?

00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:14.360
Why can I never surpass you?

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:18.079
Why are you always ahead of me?

00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:20.759
No matter how hard I try,

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:23.839
why do you always
manage to steal my limelight?

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:26.000
Why?

00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:27.079
Gu Meng.

00:05:27.639 --> 00:05:29.560
You're nothing but Jing Haisi's lapdog.

00:05:30.319 --> 00:05:33.600
Haven't you heard the saying
"you are who you surround yourself with"?

00:05:34.279 --> 00:05:37.199
I was lenient enough
to have kicked you out of the Paramount.

00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:38.720
Lu Huayan, you're wrong.

00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:42.839
I'm no longer the Gu Meng I used to be.

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:46.079
Now, not only can I disfigure you,

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:47.399
but I can also take your life

00:05:48.279 --> 00:05:49.839
as easily as crushing an ant.

00:05:57.839 --> 00:05:59.759
You think you're worthy
of being part of Wujian?

00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:02.680
I'll take back
your Wujian force right now.

00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:11.240
I don't care about others,

00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:13.120
but don't you dare touch what's mine!

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:43.800
Li Motong!

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:04.720
I am

00:07:05.879 --> 00:07:06.720
yours?

00:07:08.240 --> 00:07:09.600
You belong to Wujian.

00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:12.439
I don't mind having another helper.

00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:13.759
Yet from now on,

00:07:14.759 --> 00:07:16.439
don't interfere in human affairs.

00:07:17.600 --> 00:07:18.879
But I joined Wujian

00:07:19.240 --> 00:07:20.680
to help you with your work.

00:07:20.680 --> 00:07:21.399
Like I said,

00:07:22.079 --> 00:07:23.079
stay out

00:07:23.079 --> 00:07:24.439
of Wujian's business.

00:07:37.720 --> 00:07:39.639
(The Wujian force
grows weaker by the day.)

00:07:40.519 --> 00:07:42.360
(I must find another way.)

00:07:49.360 --> 00:07:50.040
Darling.

00:07:50.680 --> 00:07:51.240
Li Motong.

00:07:51.800 --> 00:07:53.240
Are you hiding something from me?

00:07:57.399 --> 00:07:59.199
What could I possibly
be hiding from you?

00:08:01.800 --> 00:08:02.720
With your power,

00:08:03.079 --> 00:08:04.720
how could you have lost to Jing Haisi?

00:08:05.720 --> 00:08:07.690
Is the backlash from the Mei pearl
getting worse?

00:08:07.839 --> 00:08:09.240
Did the Bodhi Fruit not work?

00:08:12.399 --> 00:08:13.639
You're overthinking.

00:08:14.920 --> 00:08:16.519
Everyone slips up sometimes.

00:08:17.879 --> 00:08:19.079
Don't be so on edge.

00:08:21.720 --> 00:08:24.040
But Miss You and Jing Haisi said

00:08:24.210 --> 00:08:26.290
that you'll die
if you don't take back the Mei pearl.

00:08:27.040 --> 00:08:29.639
Yet you told me
that as long as you ate the Bodhi Fruit,

00:08:30.240 --> 00:08:31.199
you'd be fine.

00:08:36.519 --> 00:08:37.399
Don't worry, darling.

00:08:37.480 --> 00:08:38.600
I'm really fine.

00:08:41.039 --> 00:08:42.399
Right now, what matters most

00:08:42.879 --> 00:08:45.080
is You Zimei actually
gave Gu Meng inhuman powers.

00:08:45.720 --> 00:08:47.399
It's not safe for you to go out alone.

00:08:47.840 --> 00:08:48.399
For now,

00:08:48.519 --> 00:08:50.039
don't go to the Paramount.

00:08:50.240 --> 00:08:51.799
Are you sure you're all right?

00:08:52.679 --> 00:08:54.000
Yes, darling. I'm fine.

00:09:00.320 --> 00:09:01.120
Alright, then.

00:09:01.879 --> 00:09:03.039
I can't do anything with you.

00:09:03.440 --> 00:09:05.000
I'll ask Lan for some time off

00:09:05.440 --> 00:09:07.039
to take care of you.

00:09:09.799 --> 00:09:11.240
Who's taking care of whom here?

00:09:13.639 --> 00:09:14.879
Things are dangerous right now.

00:09:15.600 --> 00:09:16.519
From today on,

00:09:16.610 --> 00:09:18.240
you have to stay
by my side at all times.

00:09:20.600 --> 00:09:22.440
If we're always together like this,

00:09:23.039 --> 00:09:25.720
your subordinates
will start teasing you.

00:09:26.120 --> 00:09:28.600
They'd call you a maniac
who dotes on his wife.

00:09:30.240 --> 00:09:31.480
A maniac who dotes on his wife?

00:09:33.200 --> 00:09:35.000
I actually like the sound of that.

00:09:36.120 --> 00:09:37.080
It's sweet as honey.
