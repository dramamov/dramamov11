[Blood River]

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:33.980
[Based on the novel of the same name from Zhou Munan's Youth in Jianghu series]

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:35.980
[Available on fanqienovel.com & bkneng.com]

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:38.980
[Episode 4]

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.930
It's you?

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:53.410
You are here.

00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:57.930
Who brought you inside?

00:01:58.430 --> 00:01:59.380
You handpicked everyone

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:00.690
in the Spider Shadow Sect.

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:02.410
Don't you trust them?

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:05.050
I believe in the results more.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.620
All of them have been loyal to you.

00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:09.220
You shouldn't suspect them.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:10.570
However,

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:12.690
you made a mistake.

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.850
What?

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:15.410
They are loyal to you

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:17.100
but it doesn't mean they are loyal to the Patriarch.

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:18.100
If they think

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:19.260
you made the wrong choice,

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:21.340
they will also think of a way

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:23.100
to guide you on the right path.

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:24.820
Let's leave it here for today,

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:25.290
Su Muyu.

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:27.170
You have many surprises around you.

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:29.010
More than I can imagine.

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:34.450
Miracle physician,

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:38.010
I beg you.

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:39.660
Don't pull it.

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:41.290
I almost forgot

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:42.450
that both of you were close friends.

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:43.890
However,

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:45.010
I was almost killed by him just now.

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:46.170
Sorry.

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:48.410
Didn't you say the Spider's Nest

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:49.410
was impenetrable?

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:50.450
How did he

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:51.610
sneak in so easily?

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:53.500
There must be a spy.

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:54.890
Don't worry, miracle physician.

00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:56.290
I will deal with it.

00:02:57.910 --> 00:02:59.010
You saw it just now.

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:00.780
Phantom Step

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:01.940
and Three-Needle Thread.

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:05.260
I only saw Three-Needle Thread.

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:08.340
I didn't expect you to know the move, Phantom Step.

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:09.820
That move...

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:10.570
What about it?

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:11.940
It's quite hard to master.

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:14.290
Do you

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:16.690
not have any questions for me?

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:19.130
Miracle physician, you know more

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:21.380
about Blood River than ordinary people.

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:23.850
I think

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:26.940
there must be something else apart from the grudge between the Patriarch

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:29.380
and the former Medicine King.

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:32.170
However, they are not related to today's matter.

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:35.380
I only want to confirm one thing.

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:36.450
What is it?

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:38.820
You are indeed doing your utmost to find a way

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:40.130
to treat the Patriarch,

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:41.060
right?

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:42.170
Yes.

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:44.500
I will do all I can

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:45.500
to treat the Patriarch.

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:48.290
I'll also make you a promise then.

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:50.290
From today onward,

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:51.780
until the Patriarch is treated,

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:53.660
I, Su Muyu, will not let anyone hurt you

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:55.940
as long as I'm alive.

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:00.540
Unless I die before you.

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:02.980
Can I trust the words of someone from Blood River?

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:06.940
I heard you were a nameless person.

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:08.940
Before you joined Blood River,

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:10.340
where were you?

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:11.730
No-sword City.

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:12.850
No-sword City?

00:04:13.710 --> 00:04:15.220
The city of swords that was unmatched in swordsmanship

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:16.930
yet got wiped out in one night?

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:17.930
Didn't they say

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:20.340
no one from the city survived?

00:04:21.270 --> 00:04:22.460
I heard you loved listening to stories.

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:25.170
If we are lucky enough to overcome this hurdle this time,

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:26.730
I'll tell you

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:27.850
my story.

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:33.540
[Shuying Villa]

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:38.100
Boss,

00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:39.810
when did you come inside?

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:41.340
I didn't even realize.

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:44.140
I've been to the Spider's Nest a few times.

00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:46.460
Of course, I know

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:48.930
how to sneak inside.

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:50.780
I forgot about it.

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:53.370
There are 36 traps here.

00:04:54.390 --> 00:04:56.100
It'll be difficult even for a formidable martial artist

00:04:56.870 --> 00:04:57.900
to leave here alive.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:04:59.540
Unless

00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:01.700
the infiltrator knows this place's structure

00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:02.490
very well.

00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:04.610
For example, me.

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:06.730
However, even someone like me

00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:09.780
has no choice

00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:13.490
but to go through one place.

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:15.250
Where is it?

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:19.050
Here.

00:05:19.950 --> 00:05:21.540
This is the core of the Spider's Nest.

00:05:22.390 --> 00:05:22.850
There are

00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:24.250
a total of four ways

00:05:24.390 --> 00:05:25.370
to avoid the 36 traps,

00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:27.460
but every way

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:33.900
passes through this place.

00:05:40.390 --> 00:05:42.020
When I came here last night,

00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:43.540
there was no one here

00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:45.170
and you

00:05:47.750 --> 00:05:49.340
were the one in charge of guarding this place.

00:05:58.720 --> 00:05:59.610
You should die.

00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:09.410
Tell me why you betray me.

00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:12.170
Boss,

00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:14.250
you know more than anyone

00:06:15.480 --> 00:06:16.540
that the Patriarch's poison

00:06:16.630 --> 00:06:17.370
cannot be cured.

00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:18.540
Even if it can be cured,

00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:19.730
he'll only live for a few more years.

00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:21.050
He should abdicate his position.

00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:28.140
You may leave.

00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:31.930
Don't appear here anymore.

00:06:33.390 --> 00:06:33.900
Boss!

00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:35.340
Just kill the Patriarch

00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:36.250
and take the Dormant Dragon Sword.

00:06:36.390 --> 00:06:37.810
Then, everything will be over!

00:06:42.270 --> 00:06:44.020
I will kill you if I must.

00:06:59.920 --> 00:07:01.050
You will never protect everyone.

00:07:28.160 --> 00:07:28.730
You

00:07:29.270 --> 00:07:30.900
shouldn't have spared him.

00:07:37.600 --> 00:07:39.050
You are the Kui of Blood River.

00:07:40.040 --> 00:07:41.700
In terms of our rank in Blood River,

00:07:42.310 --> 00:07:44.140
you are many ranks higher than I am.

00:07:45.070 --> 00:07:46.490
There's no need to show me respect.

00:07:49.800 --> 00:07:50.900
Betraying the Spider Shadow Sect

00:07:52.270 --> 00:07:54.410
is the greatest crime in Blood River.

00:07:55.680 --> 00:07:56.540
But we can

00:07:58.630 --> 00:08:00.340
only punish someone when they are alive, right?

00:08:02.920 --> 00:08:03.980
In the current situation,

00:08:05.680 --> 00:08:06.700
the Patriarch of Blood River

00:08:06.830 --> 00:08:08.460
can even be pursued by the Three Families.

00:08:10.600 --> 00:08:11.340
Do the rules

00:08:12.800 --> 00:08:14.020
still mean anything?

00:08:15.830 --> 00:08:17.850
I met you a few times

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:21.020
and heard some of your rumors.

00:08:25.190 --> 00:08:27.220
Apparently, you have a title

00:08:27.870 --> 00:08:29.050
in Soul Reapers' Hall

00:08:29.630 --> 00:08:31.290
called Three Refusals.

00:08:32.840 --> 00:08:34.770
You don't annihilate families.

00:08:35.630 --> 00:08:37.220
You don't accept jobs without knowing the reason.

00:08:38.030 --> 00:08:39.730
You don't accept jobs you don't want to.

00:08:43.600 --> 00:08:45.650
I've been a part of Blood River my whole life

00:08:46.360 --> 00:08:48.420
and you are the only one

00:08:49.200 --> 00:08:52.130
who can negotiate with Soul Reapers' Hall.

00:08:53.270 --> 00:08:54.460
Because I have a friend

00:08:56.150 --> 00:08:57.100
who also had a similar story.

00:08:58.360 --> 00:09:00.220
For the missions that Su Muyu wouldn't accept,

00:09:01.080 --> 00:09:02.010
I'll accept them all.

00:09:03.030 --> 00:09:04.370
He hid this from me for many years.

00:09:04.870 --> 00:09:06.940
He must be Su Changhe.

00:09:08.440 --> 00:09:10.250
The Undertaker, Su Changhe.

00:09:11.200 --> 00:09:11.770
Apparently,

00:09:12.720 --> 00:09:14.130
his swordsmanship isn't as good as yours

00:09:14.720 --> 00:09:16.530
but his title of the Undertaker

00:09:16.870 --> 00:09:18.250
terrorizes people

00:09:18.630 --> 00:09:21.100
more than your title of Umbrella Ghost.

00:09:23.200 --> 00:09:24.700
It's good of you

00:09:25.510 --> 00:09:26.850
to have a friend like him.

00:09:29.600 --> 00:09:30.180
I know.

00:09:31.270 --> 00:09:33.300
However, members of Blood River

00:09:34.320 --> 00:09:35.850
need no friends.

00:09:36.910 --> 00:09:37.530
Friends

00:09:38.270 --> 00:09:40.530
will only make you hesitate while wielding your sword.

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:43.730
Su Muyu,

00:09:45.270 --> 00:09:47.180
you are a genius

00:09:47.790 --> 00:09:48.770
who used an incomplete manual

00:09:48.960 --> 00:09:50.700
to restore the Eighteen-Sword Array.

00:09:51.550 --> 00:09:52.300
I didn't expect you

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:53.820
to be

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:55.530
an extremely foolish person.

00:09:56.440 --> 00:09:57.250
What do you mean, Elder?

00:09:58.750 --> 00:10:00.530
You want to be a good person.

00:10:01.120 --> 00:10:02.220
However, you want to do that

00:10:02.360 --> 00:10:04.220
as an assassin.

00:10:04.790 --> 00:10:06.980
Isn't that the funniest

00:10:08.120 --> 00:10:09.730
and most foolish thing in the world?

00:10:17.910 --> 00:10:19.540
[Seven Years Ago]
Do you know?

00:10:19.550 --> 00:10:21.420
[Wailing Abyss]
No matter who comes out alive,

00:10:21.440 --> 00:10:22.700
[Seven Years Ago, Wailing Abyss]
one of you will join the Su family.

00:10:22.840 --> 00:10:23.340
However,

00:10:23.390 --> 00:10:24.700
if both of you come out alive,

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:25.580
you'll break

00:10:25.600 --> 00:10:26.490
the rules of Blood River

00:10:26.670 --> 00:10:27.650
and must die.

00:10:28.910 --> 00:10:29.530
I know.

00:10:30.670 --> 00:10:31.220
No. 17,

00:10:32.360 --> 00:10:33.700
kill the person beside you.

00:10:42.030 --> 00:10:43.130
I won't kill him.

00:10:45.030 --> 00:10:46.060
Both of us

00:10:47.390 --> 00:10:48.650
must survive.

00:10:51.510 --> 00:10:52.100
Sure.

00:10:53.720 --> 00:10:54.300
Wonderful.

00:10:55.240 --> 00:10:56.300
In a dire situation,

00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:58.730
you still care about the person beside you.

00:10:59.480 --> 00:11:00.250
Both of you

00:11:00.320 --> 00:11:01.300
are such close friends.

00:11:01.550 --> 00:11:02.490
We are not friends.

00:11:03.360 --> 00:11:04.940
Assassins shouldn't have friends.

00:11:06.550 --> 00:11:08.010
But if we both join Blood River,

00:11:09.080 --> 00:11:10.370
we will be family.

00:11:12.150 --> 00:11:13.060
If we are family,

00:11:13.840 --> 00:11:15.130
how can I abandon him?

00:11:15.360 --> 00:11:17.420
Do you know what you are saying?

00:11:23.720 --> 00:11:24.730
Just kill me, quick.

00:11:26.790 --> 00:11:27.700
Don't be foolish.

00:11:30.630 --> 00:11:31.700
You are no match for him.

00:12:04.870 --> 00:12:05.940
If you are going to kill him,

00:12:08.120 --> 00:12:09.490
I will kill you.

00:12:11.360 --> 00:12:12.130
Stop.

00:12:20.720 --> 00:12:21.610
Sir.

00:12:21.720 --> 00:12:22.460
Sir.

00:12:24.440 --> 00:12:25.010
Kid,

00:12:26.360 --> 00:12:28.100
your actions today

00:12:28.550 --> 00:12:31.250
are a challenge to Blood River's authority.

00:12:32.320 --> 00:12:34.340
You are also challenging my authority.

00:12:35.840 --> 00:12:36.980
Do you think

00:12:37.360 --> 00:12:38.580
it is worth it for Blood River

00:12:39.790 --> 00:12:40.940
to break its rules once

00:12:41.870 --> 00:12:43.220
for both of you?

00:12:43.720 --> 00:12:44.530
Yes.

00:12:48.550 --> 00:12:49.460
Both of us

00:12:49.910 --> 00:12:50.980
will surely become

00:12:51.390 --> 00:12:53.060
the best assassins of Blood River in this century

00:12:53.080 --> 00:12:54.370
within three years.

00:12:55.120 --> 00:12:58.460
Blood River will transform because of us.

00:12:58.910 --> 00:12:59.820
Kid,

00:13:01.750 --> 00:13:02.530
I'll remember

00:13:03.120 --> 00:13:04.060
what you said.

00:13:04.600 --> 00:13:05.370
Fool.

00:13:06.080 --> 00:13:06.850
We will

00:13:07.600 --> 00:13:08.650
die together now.

00:13:09.910 --> 00:13:11.060
The rules exist

00:13:11.360 --> 00:13:12.980
to be broken.

00:13:13.840 --> 00:13:15.730
Blood River has broken many rules

00:13:16.630 --> 00:13:18.130
in the last century

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:19.460
but the rules

00:13:19.960 --> 00:13:21.060
were only broken

00:13:21.390 --> 00:13:22.700
when the offenders

00:13:23.150 --> 00:13:25.130
were powerful enough.

00:13:26.080 --> 00:13:26.580
Today,

00:13:27.200 --> 00:13:27.770
I will

00:13:28.910 --> 00:13:30.580
break the rules once for you.

00:13:36.670 --> 00:13:38.980
I will also give you a name.

00:13:39.670 --> 00:13:40.340
However,

00:13:40.720 --> 00:13:42.180
you need to prove your ability

00:13:42.510 --> 00:13:43.340
to me.

00:13:44.030 --> 00:13:45.650
I'm willing to take a sword strike from you, Sir.

00:13:47.270 --> 00:13:47.890
If I die,

00:13:49.910 --> 00:13:50.890
he will be the only one

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:52.060
leaving the Wailing Abyss.

00:13:53.440 --> 00:13:54.940
Please spare his life.

00:13:57.390 --> 00:13:58.820
If I'm still alive,

00:14:01.600 --> 00:14:02.700
I hope

00:14:02.870 --> 00:14:04.220
you give us a chance.

00:14:05.550 --> 00:14:06.980
You are loyal.

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:08.980
Sir, please

00:14:10.200 --> 00:14:10.940
attack me.

00:14:15.270 --> 00:14:15.820
All right.

00:14:31.910 --> 00:14:32.890
Remember.

00:14:34.550 --> 00:14:35.460
What I'm granting you

00:14:36.200 --> 00:14:37.700
isn't the strike

00:14:38.630 --> 00:14:40.180
but also the fate of your future.

00:14:40.790 --> 00:14:41.340
Are you

00:14:42.510 --> 00:14:44.580
going to accept my grace?

00:14:46.030 --> 00:14:47.180
Thank you, Sir.

00:14:50.790 --> 00:14:51.730
Among the three families,

00:14:52.630 --> 00:14:54.580
which family do you want to go to?

00:14:57.270 --> 00:14:57.940
He and I

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:03.130
are going to the Su family.

00:15:07.670 --> 00:15:08.460
Great.

00:15:09.360 --> 00:15:10.490
From now on,

00:15:11.240 --> 00:15:14.610
both of you are family members of the Su family.

00:15:19.600 --> 00:15:21.300
A fool like you

00:15:24.030 --> 00:15:25.060
actually did it.

00:15:28.360 --> 00:15:29.370
I have to do my best

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:33.850
for some things.

00:15:35.480 --> 00:15:37.850
[Luojiuxiao Inn]
Before you leave, I gave you the token

00:15:38.270 --> 00:15:39.130
to deploy

00:15:39.240 --> 00:15:41.180
all the elite members of the Su family.

00:15:42.270 --> 00:15:43.180
However,

00:15:43.790 --> 00:15:45.980
it seemed like you didn't cherish this power.

00:15:47.200 --> 00:15:48.420
Even Su Zhe

00:15:49.240 --> 00:15:51.420
was someone I helped you deploy.

00:15:54.790 --> 00:15:56.340
I don't want the Su family

00:15:56.480 --> 00:15:57.940
to confront Spider Shadow Sect head-on.

00:15:58.510 --> 00:15:59.180
Doing that

00:15:59.240 --> 00:16:00.180
will ruin your reputation

00:16:00.360 --> 00:16:01.180
and hurt the elite members

00:16:01.270 --> 00:16:02.130
of the Su family.

00:16:02.910 --> 00:16:03.580
However,

00:16:04.030 --> 00:16:05.460
I almost retrieved it just now

00:16:05.480 --> 00:16:06.370
without lifting a finger.

00:16:07.120 --> 00:16:07.890
So, Old Man,

00:16:08.360 --> 00:16:10.140
[Su Family's Head, Su Jinhui]
please believe in me.

00:16:10.150 --> 00:16:10.940
[Su Family's Head, Su Jinhui]
Within ten days,

00:16:11.320 --> 00:16:12.610
I'll help you retrieve the Dormant Dragon Sword.

00:16:13.360 --> 00:16:14.130
Nonsense!

00:16:22.600 --> 00:16:24.580
Old Man, let's talk this out.

00:16:27.030 --> 00:16:28.460
Why did you unsheathe your sword?

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:30.820
Did I say I was going to kill him?

00:16:35.720 --> 00:16:37.130
You might not believe me

00:16:37.870 --> 00:16:38.650
but the sword

00:16:38.840 --> 00:16:40.420
actually came out on its own.

00:16:43.870 --> 00:16:44.370
Right?

00:16:46.240 --> 00:16:46.650
Yes.

00:16:51.910 --> 00:16:52.940
You have

00:16:53.320 --> 00:16:55.300
never disappointed me.

00:16:56.080 --> 00:16:57.490
I hope

00:16:57.510 --> 00:16:59.010
you don't disappoint me again this time.

00:16:59.840 --> 00:17:01.530
Where did you go last night?

00:17:02.030 --> 00:17:03.420
I asked Su Zhe.

00:17:03.790 --> 00:17:04.900
He said he fell asleep

00:17:05.240 --> 00:17:06.490
and knew nothing.

00:17:07.590 --> 00:17:09.620
I went to scout the Spider's Nest.

00:17:13.640 --> 00:17:14.810
Did you do that alone?

00:17:18.830 --> 00:17:20.180
Many elite members of the Su family

00:17:20.310 --> 00:17:22.140
were hiding in Jiuxiao City.

00:17:22.270 --> 00:17:23.220
Why didn't you use them?

00:17:24.480 --> 00:17:25.900
Did you not trust them

00:17:26.310 --> 00:17:27.050
or

00:17:27.720 --> 00:17:29.940
were you worried that they might expose you?

00:17:37.880 --> 00:17:39.530
What are you saying, Old Man?

00:17:40.270 --> 00:17:41.220
I went to scout the place

00:17:41.240 --> 00:17:42.380
and not to kill someone.

00:17:48.270 --> 00:17:50.730
Although you are just a nobody,

00:17:51.830 --> 00:17:53.490
the only person in the Su family

00:17:53.640 --> 00:17:56.700
who has the highest chance of succeeding this task

00:17:57.480 --> 00:17:58.380
is you.

00:18:02.160 --> 00:18:03.770
I will give you more time.

00:18:05.160 --> 00:18:06.420
Get the job done

00:18:07.400 --> 00:18:09.010
and do it nicely.

00:18:09.440 --> 00:18:11.700
Don't let me down.

00:18:13.350 --> 00:18:13.980
That's right.

00:18:15.550 --> 00:18:17.700
I peeled the apple for you.

00:18:18.240 --> 00:18:18.660
Eat.

00:18:27.070 --> 00:18:28.140
Farewell, Old Man.

00:18:56.480 --> 00:18:57.620
Isn't this Chou the Ox?

00:18:58.240 --> 00:19:00.420
One of the Twelve Zodiacs of Spider Shadow

00:19:01.070 --> 00:19:02.700
isn't protecting the Patriarch in the Spider's Nest

00:19:03.480 --> 00:19:05.050
but strolling around the city

00:19:05.070 --> 00:19:06.050
sneakily.

00:19:06.400 --> 00:19:08.770
Are you trying to escape?

00:19:09.590 --> 00:19:10.530
Are you two from the Xie family?

00:19:10.720 --> 00:19:11.250
Yes.

00:19:12.550 --> 00:19:13.810
You've never seen us before

00:19:14.240 --> 00:19:14.770
but

00:19:15.270 --> 00:19:16.140
I have.

00:19:16.480 --> 00:19:17.090
When you became

00:19:17.110 --> 00:19:18.730
the Twelve Zodiacs of Spider Shadow,

00:19:18.960 --> 00:19:19.620
I went to the ceremony.

00:19:19.880 --> 00:19:20.730
I remember

00:19:20.750 --> 00:19:22.050
you swore an oath on stage

00:19:22.240 --> 00:19:24.180
to stay loyal to the Patriarch for life.

00:19:24.640 --> 00:19:25.570
Your expression

00:19:26.110 --> 00:19:27.330
was firm and confident.

00:19:27.830 --> 00:19:29.250
I never expected you

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:31.490
to escape the Spider's Nest now.

00:19:33.030 --> 00:19:33.770
So,

00:19:34.590 --> 00:19:35.980
have you betrayed the Patriarch?

00:19:36.440 --> 00:19:37.290
It has nothing to do with you.

00:19:37.640 --> 00:19:38.050
Don't move.

00:19:41.110 --> 00:19:41.980
He asked you not to move

00:19:42.270 --> 00:19:43.490
because it's a good advice.

00:19:45.790 --> 00:19:46.900
You should hand over

00:19:46.920 --> 00:19:47.940
the map of the traps inside Spider's Nest.

00:19:48.550 --> 00:19:49.290
Then, I'll spare you.

00:19:49.720 --> 00:19:50.660
Dream on.

00:20:01.920 --> 00:20:02.460
Who are you?

00:20:02.590 --> 00:20:03.490
I've never heard of

00:20:03.510 --> 00:20:03.980
such a good Dragonfang Saber

00:20:04.030 --> 00:20:04.940
in the Xie family.

00:20:05.240 --> 00:20:06.620
Of course, you've never heard about it.

00:20:06.960 --> 00:20:08.180
To defeat the Spider Shadow Sect,

00:20:08.480 --> 00:20:09.730
Every family has nurtured

00:20:09.750 --> 00:20:10.490
a group of experts.

00:20:10.880 --> 00:20:11.460
Every one of us

00:20:11.880 --> 00:20:13.700
is no worse than Su Muyu.

00:20:14.830 --> 00:20:15.620
How dare you

00:20:16.070 --> 00:20:17.460
compare yourself with the Boss?

00:20:18.310 --> 00:20:19.220
How do

00:20:19.830 --> 00:20:21.250
my saber techniques fare against

00:20:21.590 --> 00:20:22.140
his sword techniques?

00:20:25.270 --> 00:20:25.980
The Boss's sword techniques

00:20:26.440 --> 00:20:27.980
are so much stronger than yours.

00:20:28.240 --> 00:20:29.660
I hope you are not lying.

00:20:38.750 --> 00:20:39.940
Why did you kill him?

00:20:40.270 --> 00:20:41.090
He won't tell us.

00:20:42.200 --> 00:20:43.090
I could see it.

00:20:46.070 --> 00:20:46.730
Besides,

00:20:47.070 --> 00:20:48.490
the young master of the Mu family

00:20:48.640 --> 00:20:50.010
has already poisoned him with his Paper Butterflies.

00:20:50.880 --> 00:20:51.810
It's better

00:20:52.480 --> 00:20:53.570
to kill him immediately.

00:20:54.160 --> 00:20:57.940
What is your name?

00:20:59.750 --> 00:21:00.220
Buxie.

00:21:03.400 --> 00:21:05.060
[Xie Family, Xie Buxie]
I mean

00:21:05.070 --> 00:21:07.020
[Xie Family, Xie Buxie]
my name

00:21:07.030 --> 00:21:08.020
[Xie Family, Xie Buxie]
is Buxie.

00:21:13.550 --> 00:21:15.140
I'm unlucky to team up with you for a mission.

00:21:15.920 --> 00:21:16.330
Move.

00:21:25.640 --> 00:21:26.180
Let's go.

00:21:29.720 --> 00:21:30.290
Trying to leave?

00:21:31.070 --> 00:21:31.980
I finally found

00:21:32.030 --> 00:21:32.900
a spider who was left alone.

00:21:33.270 --> 00:21:34.180
If you hadn't killed him,

00:21:34.880 --> 00:21:36.140
I might be able

00:21:36.590 --> 00:21:38.330
to extract more information out of him with my poison.

00:21:38.790 --> 00:21:39.420
Who are you?

00:21:41.880 --> 00:21:43.290
She is Mu Xuewei from the Mu family.

00:21:43.640 --> 00:21:44.420
Her codename is Poisonous Blossom.

00:21:46.680 --> 00:21:47.180
Dodge it.

00:21:49.400 --> 00:21:50.420
Your saber techniques are not bad.

00:21:50.790 --> 00:21:51.700
[Mu Family, Mu Xuewei]
Unfortunately...

00:21:51.920 --> 00:21:52.700
What about it?

00:21:59.350 --> 00:22:00.980
He is Xie Qianji from the Xie family.

00:22:02.920 --> 00:22:04.250
Among the disciples of the Xie family,

00:22:04.830 --> 00:22:05.330
he is the best

00:22:05.920 --> 00:22:07.380
at setting up traps and arrays.

00:22:08.880 --> 00:22:09.490
We are all here

00:22:09.510 --> 00:22:10.660
for the same goal.

00:22:11.270 --> 00:22:12.620
There's no need to go against each other.

00:22:17.350 --> 00:22:18.940
If I remember correctly,

00:22:19.160 --> 00:22:19.900
you should be the one from the Mu family

00:22:19.920 --> 00:22:20.940
who knows fortune-telling,

00:22:21.200 --> 00:22:21.810
Mu Qingyang.

00:22:22.640 --> 00:22:23.180
That's right.

00:22:24.070 --> 00:22:24.490
Come.

00:22:24.920 --> 00:22:26.060
[Mu Family, Mu Qingyang]
Let me take a look at our fortune

00:22:26.070 --> 00:22:27.620
[Mu Family, Mu Qingyang]
and see if we are lucky.

00:22:30.200 --> 00:22:31.250
Peach blossom is a good omen.

00:22:31.590 --> 00:22:32.660
Mahogany sword is a bad omen.

00:22:33.160 --> 00:22:33.900
What do you think?

00:22:35.640 --> 00:22:37.660
Is that fortune-telling?

00:22:39.270 --> 00:22:40.730
The way is simple.

00:22:45.400 --> 00:22:46.010
There's someone else here!

00:22:50.550 --> 00:22:51.730
Acting mysterious.

00:22:56.510 --> 00:22:57.010
Stop.

00:22:57.350 --> 00:22:58.660
He is Mu Bai from the Mu family.

00:22:59.200 --> 00:22:59.860
Mu Bai?

00:23:05.640 --> 00:23:06.810
However, the Xie family

00:23:06.830 --> 00:23:07.730
lacks sincerity.

00:23:08.400 --> 00:23:09.380
They actually sent

00:23:09.510 --> 00:23:10.810
a dying person,

00:23:11.720 --> 00:23:13.010
Xie Fanhua.

00:23:15.920 --> 00:23:17.220
Since I'm dying,

00:23:18.200 --> 00:23:19.810
I'm no longer afraid of death.

00:23:20.880 --> 00:23:21.730
The six of us

00:23:22.510 --> 00:23:23.050
will be in charge

00:23:23.880 --> 00:23:26.490
of tearing down the webs that protect the Spider's Nest tomorrow.

00:23:48.400 --> 00:23:48.900
Miracle physician.

00:23:51.440 --> 00:23:52.180
Do you have something on your mind?

00:23:52.960 --> 00:23:54.900
Are you worried about Ms. Yumo?

00:23:56.030 --> 00:23:56.490
Yes.

00:23:57.510 --> 00:23:58.090
Do you

00:23:58.830 --> 00:23:59.490
like her?

00:24:02.310 --> 00:24:02.860
I do.

00:24:04.160 --> 00:24:04.940
But it's not the kind

00:24:05.030 --> 00:24:05.730
that you are thinking of.

00:24:06.960 --> 00:24:08.250
I like her as a family member.

00:24:16.030 --> 00:24:16.770
Muyu.

00:24:19.830 --> 00:24:20.380
Sir.

00:24:22.790 --> 00:24:25.090
Sir, you are finally awake.

00:24:26.750 --> 00:24:27.730
It seems like

00:24:28.310 --> 00:24:30.090
I've been sleeping for a long time.

00:24:32.720 --> 00:24:33.980
Since you are awake,

00:24:34.350 --> 00:24:34.860
I will

00:24:35.030 --> 00:24:36.570
use the Soul-Swap Technique on you

00:24:37.070 --> 00:24:37.770
to find a way

00:24:37.960 --> 00:24:39.460
of curing Snow Falls on a Plum Blossom

00:24:39.590 --> 00:24:40.090
for good.

00:24:40.830 --> 00:24:42.010
Thank you, miracle physician.

00:24:43.680 --> 00:24:44.730
Before that,

00:24:45.960 --> 00:24:47.810
I have something to say to Muyu.

00:24:48.200 --> 00:24:49.940
In that case, I'll leave you two alone.

00:25:02.240 --> 00:25:03.090
Muyu,

00:25:04.270 --> 00:25:05.250
you've worked hard

00:25:05.830 --> 00:25:06.490
up to this point.

00:25:07.200 --> 00:25:07.860
You must have

00:25:08.750 --> 00:25:09.380
met

00:25:09.400 --> 00:25:10.700
many troublesome opponents.

00:25:12.440 --> 00:25:13.290
I did meet

00:25:13.350 --> 00:25:14.090
some troublesome opponents.

00:25:14.880 --> 00:25:15.530
Thankfully,

00:25:15.640 --> 00:25:16.810
I made it to Jiuxiao City

00:25:17.550 --> 00:25:18.460
before you are cured of your poison, Sir.

00:25:25.110 --> 00:25:26.940
The Three Families will not stop attacking.

00:25:28.480 --> 00:25:29.250
Their next step

00:25:30.160 --> 00:25:31.730
will probably be thinking about

00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:33.290
capturing the Spider's Nest.

00:25:34.590 --> 00:25:36.420
The Xie and Mu families have united.

00:25:37.590 --> 00:25:38.380
I heard about it.

00:25:39.480 --> 00:25:40.180
The Twelve Zodiacs of Spider Shadow

00:25:40.200 --> 00:25:41.050
will be prepared

00:25:41.920 --> 00:25:42.860
for their arrival.

00:25:44.110 --> 00:25:44.730
The Su family

00:25:45.790 --> 00:25:47.900
won't stand idly and do nothing.

00:25:49.350 --> 00:25:50.460
Who is

00:25:51.350 --> 00:25:52.220
commanding them?

00:25:54.270 --> 00:25:55.010
It's Changhe.

00:25:58.960 --> 00:26:00.530
It's your buddy.

00:26:04.510 --> 00:26:05.050
Sir,

00:26:05.750 --> 00:26:07.090
Changhe has no choice

00:26:07.640 --> 00:26:08.460
after taking orders from the Su family.

00:26:09.920 --> 00:26:11.290
He is here to take my life.

00:26:12.030 --> 00:26:13.380
As the Kui...

00:26:14.510 --> 00:26:14.940
I will

00:26:14.960 --> 00:26:15.980
still complete my mission

00:26:16.720 --> 00:26:18.010
to stop the rebellion of the Three Families

00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:20.050
and cure your illness.

00:26:26.400 --> 00:26:27.250
Muyu.

00:26:27.720 --> 00:26:28.660
Su Muyu!

00:26:30.110 --> 00:26:31.770
You are the most conflicted

00:26:32.400 --> 00:26:33.570
and firm person I've seen.

00:26:34.590 --> 00:26:37.010
However, the sword technique of this buddy of yours

00:26:37.680 --> 00:26:39.900
seems to be stronger than mine.

00:26:56.480 --> 00:26:57.810
The gentle spring breeze is nice.

00:26:58.550 --> 00:26:59.700
What a comfortable season.

00:27:02.270 --> 00:27:03.770
Outside the Spider's Nest that day,

00:27:04.510 --> 00:27:05.940
it was the Xie family's blade that killed the man

00:27:06.750 --> 00:27:07.770
but the one who set up the Heavenly Web Array

00:27:08.680 --> 00:27:09.860
was the Mu family's ghost?

00:27:12.480 --> 00:27:12.980
Yes.

00:27:13.440 --> 00:27:14.860
The Xie and Mu families are working together now.

00:27:15.440 --> 00:27:16.620
We, the Su family,

00:27:16.640 --> 00:27:17.380
are alone now.

00:27:19.270 --> 00:27:21.010
Look how bad the Old Man

00:27:21.440 --> 00:27:22.180
is getting along with others.

00:27:24.680 --> 00:27:25.660
However, there will

00:27:25.720 --> 00:27:26.900
only be one winner in this battle.

00:27:27.640 --> 00:27:29.140
Even if they are working together now,

00:27:29.440 --> 00:27:29.860
they will still

00:27:30.270 --> 00:27:31.770
fight each other in the future.

00:27:33.880 --> 00:27:34.620
What do you think?

00:27:35.750 --> 00:27:36.250
Me?

00:27:38.110 --> 00:27:39.900
I'll just sit, stand,

00:27:40.070 --> 00:27:40.770
or even lie down

00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:43.090
to watch them fight.

00:27:47.070 --> 00:27:48.420
Owner, one suite.

00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:49.660
One?

00:27:50.480 --> 00:27:50.860
Sure.

00:27:51.830 --> 00:27:52.980
The most expensive and best suite!

00:27:53.200 --> 00:27:53.730
Laifu!

00:27:54.880 --> 00:27:55.700
Bring the guests upstairs!

00:27:56.030 --> 00:27:56.570
Sure!

00:28:00.510 --> 00:28:00.980
This way, please.

00:28:02.030 --> 00:28:02.620
Take care.

00:28:07.110 --> 00:28:09.330
This man is lucky with women.

00:28:33.440 --> 00:28:35.010
As expected, you still can't get over me.

00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:37.010
I have nothing against you.

00:28:38.070 --> 00:28:38.810
There's no reason to kill you.

00:28:45.110 --> 00:28:46.250
Before I passed out,

00:28:46.880 --> 00:28:48.050
I fell into your arms

00:28:48.720 --> 00:28:50.090
and heard

00:28:50.640 --> 00:28:51.660
your heart beating.

00:28:52.400 --> 00:28:54.180
Your heart was beating very quickly.

00:28:54.920 --> 00:28:56.050
Were you afraid that I'd die?

00:28:58.590 --> 00:28:59.010
No.

00:28:59.480 --> 00:29:01.620
If you are not worried that I might die,

00:29:02.350 --> 00:29:03.220
you must have felt shy.

00:29:05.720 --> 00:29:06.570
I told you I wasn't.

00:29:11.880 --> 00:29:12.940
You weren't?

00:29:14.510 --> 00:29:16.010
Perhaps I heard wrongly.

00:29:23.030 --> 00:29:24.330
Xuanwu Guardian,

00:29:24.920 --> 00:29:26.050
why don't you come here

00:29:26.440 --> 00:29:27.980
and let me hear your heartbeat again?

00:29:28.550 --> 00:29:29.900
Let me see if it's still the same as that time?

00:29:35.790 --> 00:29:36.460
Yue,

00:29:37.510 --> 00:29:38.810
it's late now.

00:29:40.640 --> 00:29:41.420
Do you want to rest with me?

00:29:58.920 --> 00:29:59.770
You are still injured.

00:30:00.830 --> 00:30:01.860
Don't waste your energy talking.

00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:04.010
When I wake up tomorrow,

00:30:06.030 --> 00:30:07.010
you'll leave, right?

00:30:10.030 --> 00:30:10.810
Actually,

00:30:11.400 --> 00:30:12.380
I might behave like this

00:30:13.590 --> 00:30:14.250
but I only like

00:30:14.440 --> 00:30:15.810
to tease people with words.

00:30:16.240 --> 00:30:18.460
If you don't like it, I won't tease you anymore.

00:30:22.160 --> 00:30:23.730
However, you are obviously enjoying this.

00:30:35.070 --> 00:30:35.810
Forget it.

00:30:36.200 --> 00:30:36.940
I'm tired.

00:30:37.790 --> 00:30:38.940
I can't speak too much.

00:30:39.920 --> 00:30:41.730
If you want to sleep on the bed,

00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:44.940
come over yourself.

00:30:46.720 --> 00:30:47.530
I won't be

00:30:47.920 --> 00:30:48.940
begging you.

00:30:50.550 --> 00:30:51.620
In the last twenty years,

00:30:52.440 --> 00:30:53.860
people have been pursuing me.

00:30:56.200 --> 00:30:56.730
I've never had

00:30:56.750 --> 00:30:58.380
a chance to pursue someone.

00:31:01.160 --> 00:31:01.620
I'm going out.

00:31:02.480 --> 00:31:03.140
What's wrong?

00:31:06.440 --> 00:31:07.050
I drank too much water.

00:31:19.110 --> 00:31:21.250
Half lost in the river wind, half hidden in the clouds.

00:31:23.720 --> 00:31:24.530
When you first entered the inn,

00:31:25.510 --> 00:31:26.140
I thought

00:31:26.240 --> 00:31:27.460
your back looked familiar.

00:31:28.160 --> 00:31:28.900
It's you, indeed.

00:31:31.070 --> 00:31:32.460
Why didn't you dare confront me just now

00:31:33.200 --> 00:31:34.460
yet you come and see me now?

00:31:37.550 --> 00:31:38.860
I avoided you when I didn't feel like meeting you.

00:31:39.270 --> 00:31:41.490
Now that I feel like it, I've come to meet you.

00:31:45.070 --> 00:31:45.770
The person inside the room

00:31:46.070 --> 00:31:47.010
is from Blood River.

00:31:48.240 --> 00:31:49.140
Since you are here,

00:31:49.830 --> 00:31:50.770
I'll leave her to you.

00:31:51.400 --> 00:31:52.530
I want to kill the Patriarch.

00:31:53.110 --> 00:31:54.730
I'm not interested in other members of Blood River.

00:31:56.240 --> 00:31:56.900
The person inside the room

00:31:56.960 --> 00:31:58.090
is the Patriarch's guardian.

00:31:58.680 --> 00:32:00.010
The reason why I come here

00:32:00.480 --> 00:32:01.810
is to kill the Patriarch.

00:32:02.680 --> 00:32:03.940
If you leave her to me,

00:32:05.160 --> 00:32:05.900
I will

00:32:07.680 --> 00:32:08.420
kill her.

00:32:12.830 --> 00:32:13.490
Back so soon?

00:32:15.240 --> 00:32:16.460
Did you relieve yourself in front of the door?

00:32:20.830 --> 00:32:21.420
Changhe?

00:32:21.510 --> 00:32:22.140
It's me.

00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:26.730
Have you gone mad?

00:32:28.720 --> 00:32:29.460
It seems like

00:32:29.550 --> 00:32:30.860
you still care about

00:32:31.350 --> 00:32:33.050
the prettiest woman of Blood River.

00:32:34.270 --> 00:32:35.180
You were testing me?

00:32:35.400 --> 00:32:35.900
Not at all.

00:32:36.720 --> 00:32:37.420
I just wanted to see

00:32:37.510 --> 00:32:38.940
if my Inch Sword is better

00:32:39.200 --> 00:32:40.660
or your Fingertip Blade is deadlier.

00:32:41.510 --> 00:32:42.180
However,

00:32:42.510 --> 00:32:43.490
today is not the right time.

00:32:44.200 --> 00:32:44.700
Yumo,

00:32:45.720 --> 00:32:46.290
have you decided

00:32:46.310 --> 00:32:47.050
to side with Su Muyu?

00:32:47.550 --> 00:32:48.380
I'm not siding with anyone.

00:32:49.590 --> 00:32:50.860
I'll be sleeping here.

00:32:51.480 --> 00:32:52.050
I hope

00:32:52.790 --> 00:32:53.700
you don't disturb me.

00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:55.140
It seems like

00:32:55.550 --> 00:32:56.940
Su Muyu is more important to you.

00:32:58.160 --> 00:32:58.770
Otherwise,

00:32:59.480 --> 00:33:00.940
you wouldn't help him buy time

00:33:01.310 --> 00:33:02.980
from the most dangerous guy in the Tang Clan.

00:33:06.160 --> 00:33:07.420
Don't say such nonsense.

00:33:08.270 --> 00:33:10.090
I'm clinging to Young Master Tang

00:33:11.110 --> 00:33:12.090
because I like him.

00:33:15.750 --> 00:33:16.290
Is that so?

00:33:17.110 --> 00:33:18.530
A few years ago,

00:33:18.550 --> 00:33:19.700
you even said you wanted to marry Su Muyu.

00:33:21.590 --> 00:33:23.860
Women are so fickle.

00:33:28.830 --> 00:33:29.420
Xuanwu Guardian,

00:33:30.400 --> 00:33:31.140
if you do care

00:33:31.240 --> 00:33:32.010
about my younger sister,

00:33:32.240 --> 00:33:33.770
you should protect her for a few more days.

00:33:34.440 --> 00:33:36.860
The tides are turning in Jiuxiao City.

00:33:37.590 --> 00:33:38.980
I'll help you

00:33:39.960 --> 00:33:40.980
get the Patriarch's head.

00:34:10.320 --> 00:34:10.820
Yu.

00:34:11.880 --> 00:34:12.740
They left Chou's body

00:34:13.550 --> 00:34:14.820
outside of Spider's Nest.

00:34:15.840 --> 00:34:16.980
They are trying to assert their dominance.

00:34:18.070 --> 00:34:19.010
We examined the body.

00:34:19.670 --> 00:34:20.980
He died from a blade injury

00:34:21.710 --> 00:34:22.650
but he was already poisoned

00:34:22.760 --> 00:34:23.900
by the Mu family's young master with his butterfly poison.

00:34:24.960 --> 00:34:25.570
The blade strike

00:34:26.800 --> 00:34:28.090
actually gave him an easier death.

00:34:28.760 --> 00:34:29.170
Boss,

00:34:30.150 --> 00:34:31.460
why did you let Chou go?

00:34:34.440 --> 00:34:35.260
This is no longer important.

00:34:36.280 --> 00:34:37.420
The Three Families

00:34:37.480 --> 00:34:38.170
are not going

00:34:38.190 --> 00:34:39.570
to let any one of us live.

00:34:40.920 --> 00:34:41.740
Even if it's just

00:34:41.800 --> 00:34:43.490
an uninvolved person who wants to stay out of this conflict.

00:34:44.960 --> 00:34:45.780
In that case,

00:34:47.550 --> 00:34:48.460
we'll let the Three Families

00:34:48.480 --> 00:34:49.780
pay for this.

00:34:51.190 --> 00:34:51.780
Everyone,

00:34:53.840 --> 00:34:55.490
please guard the Spider's Nest tonight.

00:34:56.360 --> 00:34:56.860
- Yes! - Yes!

00:34:58.800 --> 00:34:59.420
We won't stop

00:35:01.150 --> 00:35:02.260
until we die!
