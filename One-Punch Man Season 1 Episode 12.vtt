16:42.790 --> 16:44.730

16:45.250 --> 16:47.360

16:53.180 --> 16:56.410
<b>Do not tell me you have come

16:56.410 --> 16:58.290
<b>Are you here</b>

16:58.290 --> 17:01.210
<b>so you can create more powerful

17:01.210 --> 17:03.170
<b>Precisely.</b>

17:03.170 --> 17:05.290
<b>Powerful weapons are a necessity...</b>

17:06.170 --> 17:08.290

17:10.020 --> 17:12.240
<b>Even with powerful weapons,</b>

17:18.430 --> 17:19.740

17:50.640 --> 17:53.510

17:54.020 --> 17:57.090
<b>I swiftly implemented justice, that's all.</b>

18:02.220 --> 18:04.130

<b>Do not worry. I am fine.</b>

<b><i>too eager to eliminate evil.</i></b>

18:26.850 --> 18:28.050
<b><i>Just like me,</i></b>

18:28.050 --> 18:31.420
<b><i>he must have gone through

18:32.630 --> 18:33.480
<b><i>Wait!</i></b>

18:33.480 --> 18:35.000
<b><i>Is Sensei okay?!</i></b>

18:47.350 --> 18:49.600
<b>Oh, I'm out!</b>

18:50.110 --> 18:51.440
<b>Hey!</b>

18:51.440 --> 18:54.820
<b>Why would a Class B like you be inside the ship?</b>

18:54.820 --> 18:55.940
<b>Sensei!</b>

18:56.930 --> 18:58.240
<b>You are safe!</b>

18:58.240 --> 18:59.530
<b>Hey, Genos!</b>

18:59.530 --> 19:01.020
<b>We're done here. Let's go.</b>

19:01.020 --> 19:03.200
<b>Did you defeat their leader?</b>

19:03.200 --> 19:05.860
<b>Yeah, he was really strong.</b>

19:05.860 --> 19:07.240
<b>Maybe the strongest I've faced.</b>

19:07.240 --> 19:08.450
<b>I see.</b>

19:08.450 --> 19:11.210
<b>So without you, Sensei, the prophecy...</b>

19:11.650 --> 19:13.080
<b>about the earth's destruction</b>

19:12.420 --> 19:14.590
<b><i>They're ignoring me?</i></b>

19:13.080 --> 19:14.210
<b>would have come true.</b>

19:14.210 --> 19:14.590
<b>Nah.</b>

19:14.950 --> 19:18.130
<b>Turns out you can't trust

19:18.130 --> 19:19.800

19:20.350 --> 19:23.570
<b>I don't know how you did it,

19:25.650 --> 19:28.280

19:59.880 --> 20:01.450
<b>Whatever!</b>

<b>Why are there so many troublemakers among the elite heroes?</b>

20:10.500 --> 20:12.450

20:40.900 --> 20:42.840
